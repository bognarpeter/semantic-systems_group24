HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) resulting in less use of Peginterferon alfa-2a. Peginterferon alfa-2a is derived from the alfa-2a moeity of recombinant human interferon and acts by binding to human type 1 interferon receptors. Activation and dimerization of this receptor induces the body's innate antiviral response by activating the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. Use of Peginterferon alfa-2a is associated with a wide range of severe adverse effects including the aggravation and development of endocrine and autoimmune disorders, retinopathies, cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric complications, and increased risk of hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis. The use of Peginterferon alfa-2a has largely declined since newer interferon-free antiviral therapies have been developed.

Epoetin alfa is a 165-amino acid erythropoiesis-stimulating glycoprotein produced in cell culture using recombinant DNA technology and is used for the treatment of patients with anemia associated with various clinical conditions, such as chronic renal failure, antiviral drug therapy, chemotherapy, or a high risk for perioperative blood loss from surgical procedures [FDA Label].

Epoetin alfa biosimilar, such as Retacrit (epoetin alfa-epbx or epoetin zeta), has been formulated to allow more access to treatment options for patients in the market [L2784].

- reduction of allogeneic RBC transfusions in patients undergoing elective, noncardiac, nonvascular surgery.","Erythropoietin and epoetin alfa are involved in the regulation of erythrocyte differentiation and the maintenance of a physiological level of circulating erythrocyte mass. It is reported to increase the reticulocyte count within 10 days of initiation, followed by increases in the RBC count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, usually within 2 to 6 weeks [F85]. Depending on the dose administered, the rate of hemoglobin increase may vary. In patients receiving hemodialysis, a greater biologic response is not observed at doses exceeding 300 Units/kg 3 times weekly [F85]. 

Epoetin alfa serves to restore erythropoietin deficiency in pathological and other clinical conditions where normal production of erythropoietin is impaired or compromised. In anemic patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), administration with epoetin alfa stimulated erythropoiesis by increasing the reticulocyte count within 10 days, followed by increases in the red cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, usually within 2 to 6 weeks [FDA Label]. Epoetin alfa was shown to be effective in increasing hematocrit in zidovudine-treated HIV-infected patients and anemic cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy [FDA Label].","Erythropoietin or exogenous epoetin alfa binds to the erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R) and activates intracellular signal transduction pathways [A33079]. The affinity (Kd) of EPO for its receptor on human cells is ~100 to 200 pM [A33080]. Upon binding to EPO-R on the surface of erythroid progenitor cells, a conformational change is induced which brings EPO-R-associated Janus family tyrosine protein kinase 2 (JAK2) molecules into close proximity. JAK2 molecules are subsequently activated via phosphorylation, then phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the EPO-R that serve as docking sites for Src homology 2-domain-containing intracellular signaling proteins [A33079]. The signalling proteins include STAT5 that once phosphorylated by JAK2, dissociates from the EPO-R, dimerizes, and translocates to the nucleus where they serve as transcription factors to activate target genes involved in cell division or differentiation, including the apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-x [A33079]. The inhibition of apoptosis by the EPO-activated JAK2/STAT5/Bcl-x pathway is critical in erythroid differentiation. Via JAK2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, erythropoietin and epoetin alfa also activates other intracellular proteins involved in erythroid cell proliferation and survival, such as Shc , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase C-<U+03B3>1 [A33079].","Binding of erythropoietin and epoetin alfa to EPO-R leads to cellular internalization, which involves the degradation of the ligand. Erythropoietin and epoetin alfa may also be degraded by the reticuloendothelial scavenging pathway or lymphatic system [A33080].","The time to reach peak concentration is slower via the subcutaneous route than the intravenous route which ranges from 20 to 25 hours, and the peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (5–10% of those seen with IV administration) [A33080, L85].

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) resulting in less use of Peginterferon alfa-2b. Peginterferon alfa-2b is derived from the alfa-2b moeity of recombinant human interferon and acts by binding to human type 1 interferon receptors. Activation and dimerization of this receptor induces the body's innate antiviral response by activating the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. Use of Peginterferon alfa-2b is associated with a wide range of severe adverse effects including the aggravation and development of endocrine and autoimmune disorders, retinopathies, cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric complications, and increased risk of hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis. The use of Peginterferon alfa-2b has largely declined since newer interferon-free antiviral therapies have been developed.

Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology and is identical to endogenously produced insulin. Typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus, insulin is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.

Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after trying several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. 

Marketed as the brand name product Humulin R or Novolin R, human insulin begins to exert its effects within 30 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 3-4 hours after administration. Due to its quick onset of action, human insulin is considered ""bolus insulin"" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting ""basal insulin"" such as [DB01307], [DB09564], and [DB00047] to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.

Human insulin is also available in an inhalable form, intended to be used as a bolus meal-time insulin. Exubera was the first inhaled insulin available on the market and was developed by Inhale Therapeutics (later named Nektar Therapeutics). Unfortunately, limited uptake by physicians and patients, poor sales, bulky packaging, and concerns over the possible impact on lung cancer development resulted in Exubera products being withdrawn from the US markets [A176005]. Exubera was followed by Afrezza, a monomeric inhaled insulin developed by Mannkind Corporation, which received FDA approval in 2016. While still available in the US, Afrezza has had similar concerns associated with its use, and had an FDA ""black box"" warning added to it to warn about use in patients with chronic lung disease. Afrezza does not currently have Health Canada or European Medicines Agency approval for marketing in Canada or the EU. 

Human Insulin is a 51 residue peptide hormone produced by recombinant DNA technology by inserting the human insulin gene into Escherichia coli bacteria or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The structure is identical to native human insulin, with two amino acid chains covalently linked by disulfide bonds. 

Human insulin is also available in an intermediate-acting form as NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) as the marketed products Novolin N and Humulin N. NPH insulin is provided as a crystalline suspension of insulin with protamine and zinc, resulting in an onset of action in 1 to 3 hours, duration of action up to 24 hours, and peak action from 6 to 8 hours. Due to the added crystals, NPH insulin is typically cloudy when compared to other forms of insulin and has a neutral pH.

Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.","11061-68-0","1Y17CTI5SR",NA,NA,"liquid",2,6,0,0,"Humulin is synthesized in a special non-disease-producing laboratory strain of Escherichia coli bacteria that has been genetically altered to produce human insulin.","Human insulin is indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus.","Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Postprandial insulin spikes are responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis).","The primary activity of insulin is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin promotes glucose and amino acid uptake into muscle and adipose tissues, and other tissues except brain and liver. It also has an anabolic role in stimulating glycogen, fatty acid, and protein synthesis. Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver.
Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. These activated proteins, in turn, lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC) which play a critical role in metabolism and catabolism.","The metabolism and elimination of orally inhaled human insulin are comparable to regular human insulin.","When injected subcutaneously, the glucose-lowering effect of human insulin begins approximately 30 minutes post-dose. After a single subcutaneous administration of 0.1 unit/kg of human insulin to healthy subjects, peak insulin concentrations occurred between 1.5 to 2.5 hours post-dose. 

When administered in an inhaled form (as the product Afrezza), the time to maximum serum insulin concentration ranges from 10-20 minutes after oral inhalation of 4 to 48 units of human insulin. Serum insulin concentrations declined to baseline by approximately 60-240 minutes for these dose levels.

2. Chronic idiopathic urticaria in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older who remain symptomatic despite H1 antihistamine treatment [FDA label]","Omalizumab is a recombinant, humanized, monoclonal antibody against human immunoglobulin E (IgE) which treats the symptoms of asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria by limiting the allergic response [FDA label], [A39520].  It inhibits the binding of IgE to receptors on mast cells and basophils, blocking the IgE-mediated secretion of inflammatory mediators from these cells [A39518].

Mast cell activation and the release of mediators, in response to allergen exposure and IgE, results in a cascade of events. This cascade culminates in the activation of B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes, eosinophils, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and the endothelium. This cellular interaction, as well as the release of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors and inflammatory remodeling of the airway results in chronic asthma [A39519].

After 4 weeks of use of this medication in patients with chronic urticaria, it was found that rescue medication use was reduced significantly and quality of life improved [A39521].","When an environmental allergen first enters the body, is taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). It is then processed, and presented to T and B immune cells. This is followed by the activation of B-lymphocyte and production of allergen-specific IgE. This IgE is then released by plasma cells (converted B lymphocytes) and is therefore available to bind to IgE receptors on several other cells [A39520].

IgE binds to high-affinity (Fc€RI) and low-affinity (Fc€RII) receptors on multiple cells of the immune system. Following subsequent antigen exposure, cross-linking of the antigen occurs by several Fc€RI-bound IgE molecules on the surface of both basophils and mast cells. This leads to the activation of mast cells and histamine release, producing a wheal and other symptoms of urticaria [A39520].

The following are explanations of the mechanism of action for both indications of this drug:

**Asthma**

Omalizumab inhibits the binding of IgE to the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) on the surface of both mast cells and basophils. The reduction in surface-bound IgE on FceRI-bearing cells limits the degree of release of mediators of the typical allergic response. Treatment with omalizumab also reduces the number of FceRI receptors on basophils in atopic patients [FDA label].

Omalizumab binds to free IgE with a higher affinity than IgE itself binds to the high-affinity Fc€RI receptors found on basophils. Therefore, it decreases the availability of free IgE for binding [A39520]. Omalizumab by itself does not bind to the Fc€RI receptors, nor does the drug bind to receptor-bound IgE. These binding characteristics allow omalizumab to neutralize the typical IgE-mediated responses without causing the degranulation of basophils or cross-linking with basophil-bound IgE [A39520].

**Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria**
Omalizumab binds to IgE and decreases free IgE levels. Subsequently, IgE receptors (FceRI) on cells are down-regulated. The mechanism by which these effects of omalizumab result in an improvement of CIU symptoms is unclear[FDA label].","Monoclonal antibodies, in general, are believed to be internalized in endothelial cells bound to the Fc receptor and rescued from metabolism by recycling. At a later time, they are degraded in the reticuloendothelial system to smaller peptides and amino acids, which can then be used for de-novo protein synthesis [A31470]. Several factors may influence this process, however. These include factors related to the target antigen, antibody, and patient [A31470].

The metabolism of omalizumab is determined by its IgG1 framework, and by its specific binding to IgE. The elimination of omalizumab is dose-dependent. The reticuloendothelial system and the liver are two sites of elimination for IgG (including degradation in the liver reticuloendothelial system and endothelial cells) [F1946], [A31470].  The omalizumab:IgE complexes are thought to be to cleared via interactions with Fc- gamma-Rs (Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RII, and Fc gamma RIII) at rates that are more rapid than that of IgG clearance. The relative clearance of free omalizumab, free IgE, and complexes is summarized as: free IgE clearance > > omalizumab:IgE clearance > omalizumab clearance [F1946].

","After subcutaneous administration in pharmacokinetic studies, omalizumab was absorbed with a mean absolute bioavailability of 62% [FDA label]. After the administration of a single subcutanous dose in adult and adolescent patients with asthma, omalizumab was absorbed slowly. The peak serum concentrations peaked after an average of 7­-8 days. In patients with CIU, the peak serum concentration was reached at a similar time after a single SC dose. The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab was linear at doses which were higher than 0.5 mg/kg. In patients with asthma, after several doses of omalizumab, areas under the serum concentration-time curve from Day 0 to Day 14 at steady state were up to 6-fold of those after one dose. In patients with CIU, omalizumab showed linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 75 mg to 600 mg administered as a single subcutaneous dose.

Therefore, close clinical monitoring should be performed during and shortly after administration [FDA label].

**Maximum Dosage**

The maximum tolerated dosage of omalizumab has not yet been determined. Single intravenous (IV) doses of up to 4000 mg have been administered to patients without evidence of dose-limiting toxicity.

Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.

Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin lispro, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, and when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. 

Marketed as the brand name product Humalog, insulin lispro begins to exert its effects within 15 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 30 to 90 minutes after administration. Due to its duration of action of around 5 hours, Humalog is considered ""bolus insulin"" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting ""basal insulin"" such as [DB01307], [DB09564], or [DB00047] to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.

Insulin lispro is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli and was the first commercially available insulin analog. Formerly called LYSPRO from the chemical nomenclature [LYS(B28), PRO(B29)], insulin lispro differs from human insulin in that the amino acid proline at position B28 is replaced by lysine and the lysine in position B29 is replaced by proline. These biochemical changes result in a reduced tendency for self-association resulting in dissolution to a dimer and then to a monomer that is absorbed more rapidly after subcutaneous injection compared to endogenous human insulin. 

Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.","133107-64-9","GFX7QIS1II",NA,NA,"liquid",1,7,0,0,NA,"Insulin lispro is indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and children with diabetes mellitus.","Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin lispro is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours. Compared to regular human insulin, insulin lispro  has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action. Insulin lispro is also shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis.","Insulin lispro binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Reversal of the proline and lysine residues at positions B28 and B29 of native insulin eliminates hydrophobic interactions and weakens some of the hydrogen bonds that contribute to the stability of the insulin dimers that comprise insulin hexamers. Hexamers of insulin lispro are produced in the presence of zinc and <i>m</i>-cresol. These weakly associated hexamers quickly dissociate upon subcutaneous injection and are absorbed as monomers through vascular endothelial cells. These properties give insulin lispro its fast-acting properties.","Insulin is predominantly cleared by metabolic degradation via a receptor-mediated process.","Insulin lispro is rapidly absorbed following subcutaneous administration. It is also absorbed more quickly than regular human insulin. Peak serum levels occur 30-90 minutes after injection in healthy subjects. Absorption also differs depending on the site of injection. After insulin lispro was administered in the abdomen, serum drug levels were higher and the duration of action was slightly shorter than after deltoid or thigh administration. The absolute bioavailability after subcutaneous injection ranges from 55% to 77% with doses between 0.1 to 0.2 unit/kg, inclusive.

Available as the brand name product Lantus, insulin glargine has a duration of action up to 24 hours allowing for once-daily dosing, typically at bedtime. Due to its duration of action, Lantus is considered ""basal insulin"" as it provides low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Basal insulin is often combined with short-acting ""bolus insulin"" such as [DB00046], [DB01309], and [DB01306] to provide higher doses of insulin that are required following meals. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia. 

Insulin glargine is also available as the biosimilar, or ""follow-on"" product, Basaglar in the US and as Abasaglar in the EU. As of 2015, insulin glargine was reformulated by Sanofi as the product Toujeo in an extra-concentrated form containing 300IU/mL (compared to 100IU/mL contained in Lantus). Use of the higher concentrated Toujeo as compared to Lantus results in slightly different pharmacokinetics, with a later onset (up to 6 hours) and duration of action (up to 30 hours). 

Insulin glargine is produced by recombinant DNA technology using a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (K12) as the production organism. Insulin glargine differs from endogenous human insulin by the replacement of an asparagine residue at position A21 of the A-chain with glycine and addition of two arginines to the C-terminus (positions B31 and 32) of the B-chain. The resulting protein is soluble at pH 4 and forms microprecipitates at physiological pH 7.4 allowing for the slow release of small amounts of insulin glargine, giving the drug a long duration of action and no pronounced peak concentration.

It is utilized to increase the circulating plasma volume, which reduces hemoconcentration and blood viscosity. Albumin is also used as a transport protein that binds naturally occurring, therapeutic and toxic materials and drugs in the circulation [F229]. 

Human albumin makes up over 50% the total protein in the plasma and represents about 10% of protein synthesis activity by the liver. Human Albumin 25% has a corresponding hyper-oncotic effect [F230].","The main function of albumin results from its contribution to plasma colloid oncotic pressure and transport function [F230].  

Albumin stabilizes circulating blood volume and carries hormones, enzymes, medicines, and toxins. Other physiological functions include antioxidant properties, free radical scavenging, in addition to maintenance capillary membrane integrity [F230].

Exogenously administered albumin increases the oncotic pressure of the intravascular system, moving fluids from the interstitial space, thereby decreasing edema and increasing the circulating blood volume. The increase in volume reduces the concentration and viscosity of blood in patients with decreased circulating blood volume while maintaining cardiac output in shock. In dehydrated patients, negligible effects exist on circulating blood volume. In addition to the above albumin replaces protein in patients with hypoproteinemia until the cause of the deficiency can be determined [L3104]. 

 This drug has thousands of endogenous and exogenous targets. Human albumin also binds and carries a plethora of hydrophobic molecules, such as endogenous (i.e., cholesterol, fatty acids, bilirubin, thyroxine) or exogenous substances (for example, drugs and toxins), transition metal ions, as well as gas (nitric oxide [NO]), with resulting implications for their solubilisation, transport, metabolism, and detoxification [A40060].",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Albumin is distributed throughout the extracellular space and more than 60% of the body albumin pool is located in the extravascular fluid space [F230].

Infliximab is produced by a recombinant cell line cultured by continuous perfusion. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) is a key proinflammatory cytokine involved in chronic inflammatory diseases [A31469]. Its hyperactivity and enhanced signalling pathways can be observed in inflammatory diseases where it activates further pro-inflammatory cascades. By binding to both the soluble subunit and the membrane-bound precursor of TNF-a [A106], infliximab disrupts the interaction of TNF-a with its receptors and may also cause lysis of cells that produce TNF-a [A106].

Infliximab was first approved by the FDA in 1998 under the market name Remicade as an intravenous injection. It is indicated for the treatment of various inflammatory disorders such as adult or pediatric Chron's disease, adult or pediatric ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis in combination with methotrexate, ankylosing spondyliti, psoriatic arthritis, and plaque psoriasis [FDA Label]. In clinical trials, multiple infusions of infliximab displayed in a reduction of signs and symptoms of inflammatory diseases and induction of remission in patients who have had an inadequate response to alternative first-line therapies for that disorder [FDA Label]. 

There are currently two biosilimars of infliximab available in the US market that demonstrate a high degree of similarity to the reference product, Remicade. They are approved for all eligible indications of the reference product. Inflectra, a first biosimilar drug product, was approved in 2016.

Infliximab has shown to reduce infiltration of inflammatory cells into sites of inflammation. It also attenautes the expression of molecules mediating cellular adhesion {including E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)}, chemoattraction {[IL-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1)} and tissue degradation {matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 and 3} [FDA Label].","Infliximab is a IgG1<U+03BA> monoclonal antibody that binds to soluble and transmembrane forms of TNF-a with high affinity to disrupt the pro-inflammatory cascade signalling. Binding of the antibody to TNF-a prevents TNF-a from interacting with its receptors. Infliximab does not neutralize TNF-a (lymphotoxin-a), a related cytokine that utilizes the same receptors as TNF-a [FDA Label]. Blocked actions of TNF-a further leads to downregulation of local and systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-1, IL-6), reduction of lymphocyte and leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation, induction of apoptosis of TNF-producing cells (i.e. activated monocytes and T lymphocytes), increased levels of nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B inhibitor, and reduction of reduction of endothelial adhesion molecules and acute phase proteins [A31469]. Its inhibitory actions on TNF-a was demonstrated in human fibroblasts, endothelial cells, neutrophils, B and Tlymphocytes and epithelial cells [FDA Label]. Infliximab also atteunates the production of tissue degrading enzymes synthesized by synoviocytes and/or chondrocytes.

These activated proteins, in turn, lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC) which play a critical role in metabolism.","Insulin is predominantly cleared by metabolic degradation via a receptor-mediated process.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,519,NA

It is used as a treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2+ metastatic breast cancer, where there is a proven amplification of the HER-2 oncogene or over-expression of the HER-2 protein in tumours. It is suggested that the overexpression or gene amplification of HER2 has been found in about 20–30% of breast cancers and elevated activation of HER2 triggers multiple downstream pathways leading to abnormal proliferation of cancer cells [A121]. Trastuzumab binds to HER2 and suppresses cancer cells growth, proliferation, and survival directly and indirectly [A121].

In December 2017, FDA approved Ogivri (trastuzumab-dkst) as a biosimilar to Herceptin (trastuzumab) for the treatment of patients with breast or metastatic stomach cancer (gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma) whose tumors overexpress the HER2 gene (HER2+). It displays biosimilar properties as Herceptin according to clinical data. While Ogivri is the first biosimilar approved in the U.S. for the treatment of breast cancer or stomach cancer, it is the second biosimilar approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cancer. Herzuma (trastuzumab-pkrb) is a biosimilar drug approved in December 2018 for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. KANJINTI (trastuzumab-anns) is another biosimilar approved by the FDA in June 2019.[L6715]","180288-69-1","P188ANX8CK",NA,NA,"liquid",2,7,0,3,NA,"Indicated for treatment of early stage HER2-positive breast cancer, or metastatic breast cancer that substantially overexpress HER2. The intravenous powder for solution, OGIVRI, is approved in Canada for early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer, and gastric cancer, provided these cancers overexpress HER2[L6214].","Trastuzumab exerts an antitumour activity and is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. HER2 protein overexpression is observed in 20%-30% of primary breast cancers [A40277] thus HER2 presents as a useful therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancers. Trastuzumab has been shown, in both _in vitro_ assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumour cells that overexpress HER2. It works as a mediator of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, where it binds as an antibody to cells over-expressing HER2, leading to preferential cell death. Trastuzumab was also shown to inhibit angiogenesis of tumor cells _in vivo_ [A121]. Higher doses and longer dosing intervals show no significant benefit over standard dose schedules [A40276]. In patients with HER2 positive solid tumours, trastuzumab did not exert any clinically significant QTc interval duration [FDA Label].","Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the HER-2 receptor, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptors which is a photo-oncogene. Over-expressed in breast tumour cells, HER-2 overamplifies the signal provided by other receptors of the HER family by forming heterodimers [A121]. The HER-2 receptor is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular or cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. It is activated by the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with other EGFR proteins, leading to dimerization and autophosphorylation and/or transphosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in EGFR intracellular domains [A121]. Further downstream molecular signaling cascades are activated, such as the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and the phospholipase C<U+03B3> (PLC<U+03B3>)/protein kinase C (PKC) pathways that promote cell growth and survival and cell cycle progression [A121]. Due to upregulation of HER-2 in tumour cells, hyperactivation of these signaling pathways and abnormal cell proliferation is observed. Trastuzumab binds to the extracellular ligand-binding domain and blocks the cleavage of the extracellular domain of HER-2 to induce its antibody-induced receptor downmodulation [A121], and subsequently inhibits HER-2-mediated intracellular signaling cascades. Inhibition of MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways lead to an increase in cell cycle arrest, and the suppression of cell growth and proliferation [A121]. Trastuzumab also mediates the activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [A40276] by attracting the immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, to tumor sites that overexpress HER-2 [A121]. Intrinsic trastuzumab resistance has been noted for some patients with HER-2 positive breast cancer. Mechanisms involving trastuzumab resistance include deficiency of phosphatase and tensin homologue and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and the overexpression of other surface receptors, such as insulin-like growth factor [A40276].","After it binds to HER-2, trastuzumab is likely to metabolized nonspecifically into smaller peptides and amino acids [A40276].","Peak and trough plasma concentrations at steady state (between weeks 16 and 32) were approximately 123 and 79 mcg/mL, respectively.

non-Hodgkin's lymphomas [A124]. The antibody leads to selective killing of B-cells.   The following are the pharmacodynamic outcomes for various conditions, including non- Hodgkin's Lymphoma [FDA label]:

**Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL)**
In Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma patients, the administration of rituximab led to the depletion of circulating and tissue-based B cells. Among 166 patients in Study 1, circulating CD19-positive B cells were depleted within the first three weeks, showing sustained depletion for up to 6-9 months post-treatment in 83% of treated patients. B-cell recovery began at approximately 6 months and median B-cell levels returned to normal by 12 months following the completion of treatment [FDA label]. There were sustained and statistically significant decreases in serum IgM and IgG levels measured from 5-11 months following rituximab administration; 14% of patients showed IgM and/or IgG serum levels below the normal range [FDA label].

**Rheumatoid Arthritis**
In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, treatment with rituximab induced the depletion of peripheral B lymphocytes, with the majority of patients showing near complete depletion (CD19 counts below the lower limit of quantification, 20 c-lls/µl) within 2 weeks after the first dose of rituximab. The majority of treated patients showed peripheral B-cell depletion, sustained for a minimum of 6 months. A small percentage of patients (~4%) had peripheral B-cell depletion that was sustained for more than 3 years after one course of treatment. Total serum immunoglobulin levels, IgM, IgG, and IgA were decreased at 6 months with the greatest change observed in IgM. At Week 24 of the first cycle of rituximab treatment, small percentages of patients experienced decreases in IgM (10%), IgG (2.8%), and IgA (0.8%) levels below the lower limit of normal (LLN). When rituximab was administered to RA patients during repeated rituximab treatment, 23.3%, 5.5%, and 0.5% of patients experienced decreases in IgM, IgG, and IgA concentrations below LLN at any time after receiving rituximab, respectively. The clinical consequences of decreases in immunoglobulin levels in RA patients treated with rituximab are not clear at this time. Treatment with rituximab in patients with RA was associated with a decreased level of several biologic markers of inflammation such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid protein (SAA), S100 A8/S100 A9 heterodimer complex (S100 A8/9), anti-citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), and RF [FDA label] and was found to decrease disease symptoms [A125].

**Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener’s Granulomatosis) and Microscopic Polyangiitis**
In GPA and MPA patients, peripheral blood CD19 B-cells were depleted to less than 10 cells/µl after the first two infusions of rituximab, and remained at the same level in most (84%) patients through Month 6 of the treatment. By Month 12, most patients (81%) demonstrated signs of B-cell return with counts >10 cells/µL. By Month 18, the majority of patients (87%) had counts >10 cells/µL [FDA label].","Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen, which is expressed on the surface of pre-B and mature B-lymphocytes [A124], [A125], [A126], [FDA label]. After binding to CD20, rituximab mediates B-cell lysis (or breakdown). The possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [FDA label].

Rituximab belongs to the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) sub-class, consisting of a murine variable region (Fab region) and a human constant region (Fc region). The Fab region has variable sections that define a specific target antigen, allowing the antibody to attract and secure its exclusive antigen, specifically the binding of rituximab (IgG1) to CD20 on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. The Fc region is the tail end of the antibody that communicates with cell surface receptors to activate the immune system, in this case, a sequence of events leading to the depletion of circulating B lymphocytes by complement-dependent cell lysis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, as well as apoptosis [A40017].

In regards to the mechanism of action in rheumatoid arthritis, B cells are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the associated condition of chronic synovitis. B cells may act at various sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or the production of proinflammatory cytokines [FDA label].  The administration of rituximab in this condition has been shown to result in significant clinical and symptomatic improvements [A125], [FDA label].","Most likely removed by opsonization via the reticuloendothelial system [A40006].","Following the administration of 2 doses of rituximab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the mean (± S.D.; % CV) concentrations after the first infusion (Cmax first) and second infusion (Cmax second) were : 157 ( ± 46; 29%) and 183 ( ± 55; 30%) mcg/mL, and 318 ( ± 86; 27%) and 381 ( ± 98; 26%) mcg/mL for the 2 × 500 mg and 2 × 1000 mg doses, respectively [FDA label].","**Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma**: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from 298 Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) patients who received rituximab once weekly or once every three weeks, the estimated median terminal elimination half-life was 22 days (range, 6.1 to 52 days) [FDA label].

Cyclosporine has shown efficacy in induced animal models of conditions that are proven to have an immune component. The range of tested conditions goes from asthma to multiple sclerosis.

Cyclosporine showed a good profile in the prophylaxis and treatment of keratoconjunctivitis and arthritis as well as a prophylactic agent in vitiligo and diabetes mellitus.[A174088]

Cyclosporine has been attributed to some vasoconstrictor activities which provide a potential to cause hypertension and renal dysfunction. In the kidneys, it has been shown to affect the proximal tubule and afferent arteriole indicating the potential of nephrotoxicity.[A174088]","In a nutshell, cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor and this activity allows for inhibition of T cell activation.[A174049]

Cyclosporine's pharmacological action is obtained by the binding to the intracellular receptor cyclophilin-1 which produces the complex ciclosporin-cyclophilin. This complex will in order inhibit calcineurin which will prevent the dephosphorylation and activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT). The NF-AT is a transcription factor that regulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha.[A174049]

The critical role of this inhibition cascade relies on the specific inhibition of IL-2 due to the major role of this interleukin on the activation and proliferation of T cells. On the second plane, the inhibition of NF-AT also produces a deficiency of other factors related to T helper cell differentiation, T cell tolerance, and thymocyte development. Some reports even indicate a role of NF-AT on innate immunity giving cyclosporine a regulatory activity on both innate and adaptative immune responses.[A174049]","Cyclosporine is metabolized in the intestine and the liver by the action of the CYP450 isoenzyme group.[A174049] There is no single major metabolic pathway and from cyclosporine metabolism, there have been observed over 30 different metabolites. The most active metabolite shows only 10-20% activity when compared to the parent compound and they do not act synergistically.[A174088]

The presence of a second peak is thought to be due to enhanced absorption due to concomitant food administration as bile can increase cyclosporine absorption.[A174088]

It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and can increase the cost of cancer therapy. In these cases, colony stimulating factor is necessary to restore important cells for immune function [A35591].

For over twenty years, granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs; filgrastims) have been a pillar of treatment and prevention of CIN, and have been found to reduce the risk of neutropenia across various patient settings, decrease the incidence of febrile neutropenia, reduce the incidence of infection, reduce the requirement for treatment with antibiotics, and accelerate neutrophil recovery [A35591].

Filgrastim is a recombinant, non-pegylated human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) analog. It is marketed as the brand name _Neupogen_ by Amgen (initially approved in 1998) and as _Nivestym_, a biosimilar agent by Pfizer. Nivestym was approved by the FDA on July 20th, 2018 [L3735].  Between 1998 and the present, Neupogen/filgrastim has been approved for various indications [L3744].

 _Tbo-filgrastim_, which is marketed by Sicor Biotech and FDA approved on August 29, 2012, contains the same active ingredient as Neupogen and is biologically similar, but it is formulated to be short-acting [F719]. On March 6, 2015, the FDA approved the biosimilar Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz) and is indicated for use in the same conditions as Neupogen.

Neupogen is approved for treatment of patients with radiation-induced myelosuppression following a radiological/nuclear incident [L3739].","Filgrastim binds to the G-CSF receptor and stimulates the production of neutrophils in the bone marrow [FDA label].
Colony-stimulating factors are glycoproteins which act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors, in turn, stimulating proliferation and differentiation [F714].

G-CSF and its receptor are necessary for basal and stress-induced granulopoiesis, which forms neutrophils. Mice deficient in G-CSF or G-CSFR have severe neutropenia and reduced levels (~50%) of late-stage neutrophil precursors in the bone marrow under normal, resting conditions [A35605].


Endogenous G-CSF is a lineage-specific colony-stimulating factor that is produced by monocytes‚ fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. G-CSF regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and enhances neutrophil progenitor proliferation‚ differentiation, and selected end-cell functions (including enhanced phagocytic ability‚ priming of the cellular metabolism associated with respiratory burst‚ antibody-dependent killing, and enhanced expression of certain cell surface antigens). G-CSF is not species-specific and has demonstrated to have negligible direct in vivo or in vitro effects on the production or action of hematopoietic cell types other than the neutrophil and its lineage[F714].","As a G-CSF analog, this drug controls the proliferation of committed progenitor cells and influences their maturation into mature neutrophils. Filgrastim also stimulates the release of neutrophils from bone marrow storage pools and decreases their time to maturation. Filgrastim acts to increase the phagocytic activity of mature neutrophils, thus allowing them to prevent infection. In patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, filgrastim may accelerate neutrophil recovery, leading to a reduction in the duration of the neutropenic phase post chemotherapy [FDA label].

Used in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia by enhancing the production of neutrophils, filgrastim acts on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors, thereby stimulating proliferation, differentiation, commitment, and end cell functional activation. In one efficacy study, levels of neutrophils returned to baseline by 21 days following completion of chemotherapy and the administration of tbo-filgrastim (fast-acting) [F719].

In phase 1 studies involving 96 patients with various non-myeloid malignancies‚ filgrastim administration resulted in a dose-dependent increase in circulating neutrophil counts over the dose range of 1 to 70 mcg/kg/day. 

This increase in neutrophil counts was seen whether filgrastim was administered intravenous (1 to 70 mcg/kg twice daily)‚ subcutaneous (1 to 3 mcg/kg once daily)‚ or by continuous subcutaneous (SC) infusion (3 to 11 mcg/kg/day). After the discontinuation of filgrastim therapy‚ neutrophil counts returned to baseline in most cases within only 4 days after Nevistym was used [FDA label].",NA,"Absorption and clearance of Neupogen follows first-order pharmacokinetics without concentration dependence. 
Subcutaneous administration of 3.45 mcg/kg and 11.5 mcg/kg of filgrastim resulted in maximum serum concentrations of 4 and 49 ng/mL‚ respectively‚ within 2-8 hours [FDA label]. Filgrastim does not accumulate. It is estimated that when filgrastim is subcutaneously administered, the absolute bioavailability is approximately 62% and 71% for 375 mcg and 750 mcg doses respectively. When 5 mcg/kg tbo-filgrastim is subcutaneously administered, the absolute bioavailability is 33%.

**Injection forms (subcutaneous, intramuscular)**

These forms are indicated for vitamin B12 deficiencies due to various causes, with or without neurologic manifestations [F3736].  Vitamin B12 deficiency is frequently caused by malabsorption, which is often associated with the following conditions [L5545]:

Vitamin B12 supplements are widely available and indicated in patients who require supplementation for various reasons.  Dose requirements for vitamin B12 which are higher than normal (caused by pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be achieved with oral supplementation [L5545].   Oral products of vitamin B12 are not recommended in patients with malabsorption, as these forms are primarily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract [F3739].","
**General effects**

Cyanocobalamin corrects vitamin B12 deficiency and improves the symptoms and laboratory abnormalities associated with pernicious anemia (megaloblastic indices, gastrointestinal lesions, and neurologic damage). This drug aids in growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, nucleoprotein, and myelin synthesis.  It also plays an important role in fat metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, as well as protein synthesis. Cells that undergo rapid division (for example, epithelial cells, bone marrow, and myeloid cells) have a high demand for vitamin B12 [A175255]. 
 
**Parenteral cyanocobalamin effects**

The parenteral administration of vitamin B12 rapidly and completely reverses the megaloblastic anemia and gastrointestinal symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency. Rapid parenteral administration of vitamin B12 in deficiency related neurological damage prevents the progression of this condition [L5545]. 

**Nasal spray effects**

In 24 vitamin B12 deficient patients who were already stabilized on intramuscular (IM) vitamin B12 therapy, single daily doses of intranasal cyanocobalamin for 8 weeks lead to serum vitamin B12 concentrations that were within the target therapeutic range (>200 ng/L) [FDA label].
","Vitamin B12 serves as a cofactor for _methionine synthase_ and _L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase_ enzymes. Methionine synthase is essential for the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines that form DNA. L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to _succinyl-CoA_ in the degradation of propionate [L2064], an important reaction required for both fat and protein metabolism. It is a lack of vitamin B12 cofactor in the above reaction and the resulting accumulation of methylmalonyl CoA that is believed to be responsible for the neurological manifestations of B12 deficiency [A175255]. Succinyl-CoA is also necessary for the synthesis of hemoglobin [L2064]. 

In tissues, vitamin B12 is required for the synthesis of _methionine_ from homocysteine.   Methionine is required for the formation of S-adenosylmethionine, a methyl donor for nearly 100 substrates, comprised of DNA, RNA, hormones, proteins, as well as lipids [L2064]. Without vitamin B12, tetrahydrofolate cannot be regenerated from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and this can lead to functional folate deficiency [L5554], [FDA label]. 
This reaction is dependent on methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) as a co-factor and is also dependent on folate, in which the methyl group of methyltetrahydrofolate is transferred to homocysteine to form _methionine_ and _tetrahydrofolate_. Vitamin B12 incorporates into circulating folic acid into growing red blood cells; retaining the folate in these cells [L5557]. A deficiency of vitamin B12 and the interruption of this reaction leads to the development of megaloblastic anemia.","Vitamin B12 or cyanocobalamin obtained from food is initially bound by _haptocorrin_, a protein found in the saliva with high affinity for B12. This forms a _haptocorrin-B12_ complex.   Cyanocobalamin passes through the stomach and is protected from acid degradation due to its binding to haptocorrin. In the duodenum, pancreatic _proteases_ release cobalamin from the _haptocorrin-B12 complex_ and from other proteins containing protein-bound B12 that have been ingested. Following this, the binding of cobalamin to a second glycoprotein, _intrinsic factor_, promotes its uptake by terminal ileum mucosal cells by a process called _cubilin_/AMN receptor-mediated endocytosis. After absorption into enterocytes, intrinsic factor is broken down in the lysosome, and cobalamin is then released into the bloodstream. The transporter ABCC1,  found in the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial and other cells, exports cobalamin bound to transcobalamin out of the cell [A175273]. Cyanocobalamin then passes through the portal vein in the liver, and then reaches the systemic circulation.  The active forms of cyanocobalamin are _methylcobalamin_ and _adenosylcobalamin_ [A175273], [L2064].","Vitamin B12 is quickly absorbed from intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SC) sites of injection;  with peak plasma concentrations achieved about 1 hour after IM injection [F3736].

Orally administered vitamin B12 binds to intrinsic factor (IF) during its transport through the stomach. The separation of Vitamin B12 and IF occurs in the terminal ileum when calcium is present, and vitamin B12 is then absorbed into the gastrointestinal mucosal cells. It is then transported by transcobalamin binding proteins [L5545].  Passive diffusion through the intestinal wall can occur, however, high doses of vitamin B12 are required in this case (i.e. >1 mg). After the administration of oral doses less than 3 mcg, peak plasma concentrations are not reached for 8 to 12 hours, because the vitamin is temporarily retained in the wall of the lower ileum [F3736].","Approximately 6 days (400 days in the liver) [F3739].","Very high (to specific plasma proteins called transcobalamins); binding of hydroxocobalamin is slightly higher than cyanocobalamin [FDA label.","This drug is partially excreted in the urine [F3739]. According to a clinical study, approximately 3-8 mcg of vitamin B12 is secreted into the gastrointestinal tract daily via the bile. In patients with adequate levels of intrinsic factor, all except approximately 1 mcg is reabsorbed. When vitamin B12 is administered in higher doses that saturate the binding capacity of plasma proteins and the liver, the unbound vitamin B12 is eliminated rapidly in the urine. The body storage of vitamin B12 is dose-dependent [FDA label].","Cobalamin is distributed to tissues and stored mainly in the liver and bone marrow [FDA label].","During vitamin loading, the kidney accumulates large amounts of unbound vitamin B12. This drug is cleared partially by the kidney, however, multiligand receptor _megalin_ promotes the reuptake and reabsorption of vitamin B12 into the body [A175267], [A175270].","BedodekaTevaBedozBerubigenUpjohnBetalinLillyCobioneMSDCobolin-MCrystamineCyanojectCyominCytakonGlaxoSmithKlineCytamenGlaxoSmithKlineDicopacNeuroforte-RPrimabaltVitabee 12",0,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00115.pdf?1551305348","//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00115.pdf?1265922742",0,816,"LD50 Oral (mouse):  > 5,000 mg/kg [F3733]. 


**General toxicity**

Vitamin B12 is generally non-toxic, even at higher doses. Mild, transient diarrhea, polycythemia vera, peripheral vascular thrombosis, itching, transitory exanthema, a feeling of swelling of entire body, pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure in early treatment stages, anaphylactic shock and death have been observed after vitamin B12 administration [F3736].

**Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis**

Long term studies in animals examining the carcinogenic potential of any of the vitamin B12 formulations have not completed to date.  There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that vitamin B12 has carcinogenic potential. Pernicious
anemia is known to be associated with an increased incidence of stomach carcinoma, however, this malignancy has been attributed to the underlying cause of pernicious anemia and has not been found to be related to treatment with vitamin B12 [FDA label].

**Use in pregnancy**

 No adverse effects have been reported with ingestion of normal daily requirements during pregnancy [F3736]. 

**A note on the use of the nasal spray in pregnancy**

Although vitamin B12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy, it is currently unknown whether the nasal spray form can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. The nasal spray form should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed, as it is considered a pregnancy category C drug in this form. Sufficient well-controlled studies have not been done to this date in pregnant women [FDA label].

**Use in lactation**

Vitamin B12 has been found distributed into the milk of nursing women in concentrations similar to the maternal blood vitamin B12 concentrations. No adverse effects have been reported to date with intake of normal required doses during lactation [F3736].

However, some facts are known about L-histidine and some of its metabolites, such as histamine and trans-urocanic acid, which suggest that supplemental L-histidine may one day be shown to have immunomodulatory and/or antioxidant activities. Low free histidine has been found in the serum of some rheumatoid arthritis patients. Serum concentrations of other amino acids have been found to be normal in these patients. L-histidine is an excellent chelating agent for such metals as copper, iron and zinc. Copper and iron participate in a reaction (Fenton reaction) that generates potent reactive oxygen species that could be destructive to tissues, including joints. <br/>L-histidine is the obligate precursor of histamine, which is produced via the decarboxylation of the amino acid. In experimental animals, tissue histamine levels increase as the amount of dietary L-histidine increases. It is likely that this would be the case in humans as well. Histamine is known to possess immunomodulatory and antioxidant activity. Suppressor T cells have H2 receptors, and histamine activates them. Promotion of suppressor T cell activity could be beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis. Further, histamine has been shown to down-regulate the production of reactive oxygen species in phagocytic cells, such as monocytes, by binding to the H2 receptors on these cells. Decreased reactive oxygen species production by phagocytes could play antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory roles in such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis. <br/>This latter mechanism is the rationale for the use of histamine itself in several clinical trials studying histamine for the treatment of certain types of cancer and viral diseases. In these trials, down-regulation by histamine of reactive oxygen species formation appears to inhibit the suppression of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, allowing these cells to be more effective in attacking cancer cells and virally infected cells.",NA,"Absorbed from the small intestine via an active transport mechanism requiring the presence of sodium.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00117.pdf?1265922748",0,0,"ORL-RAT LD<sub>50</sub> > 15000 mg/kg, IPR-RAT LD<sub>50</sub> > 8000 mg/kg, ORL-MUS LD<sub>50</sub> > 15000 mg/kg, IVN-MUS LD<sub>50</sub> > 2000 mg/kg; Mild gastrointestinal side effects."

NO is produced by all tissues of the body and plays very important roles in the cardiovascular system, immune system and nervous system. NO is formed from L-arginine via the enzyme nitric oxide synthase or synthetase (NOS), and the effects of NO are mainly mediated by 3,'5' -cyclic guanylate or cyclic GMP. NO activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP from guanosine triphosphate or GTP. Cyclic GMP is converted to guanylic acid via the enzyme cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. NOS is a heme-containing enzyme with some sequences similar to cytochrome P-450 reductase. Several isoforms of NOS exist, two of which are constitutive and one of which is inducible by immunological stimuli. The constitutive NOS found in the vascular endothelium is designated eNOS and that present in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system is designated nNOS. The form of NOS induced by immunological or inflammatory stimuli is known as iNOS. iNOS may be expressed constitutively in select tissues such as lung epithelium. All the nitric oxide synthases use NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and oxygen (O2) as cosubstrates, as well as the cofactors FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), FMN (flavin mononucleotide), tetrahydrobiopterin and heme. Interestingly, ascorbic acid appears to enhance NOS activity by increasing intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin. eNOS and nNOS synthesize NO in response to an increased concentration of calcium ions or in some cases in response to calcium-independent stimuli, such as shear stress. In vitro studies of NOS indicate that the Km of the enzyme for L-arginine is in the micromolar range. The concentration of L-arginine in endothelial cells, as well as in other cells, and in plasma is in the millimolar range. What this means is that, under physiological conditions, NOS is saturated with its L-arginine substrate. In other words, L-arginine would not be expected to be rate-limiting for the enzyme, and it would not appear that supraphysiological levels of L-arginine which could occur with oral supplementation of the amino acid^would make any difference with regard to NO production.

Used to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients 5 years of age and older [FDA Label].","Like other amino acids, glutamine is biochemically important as a constituent of proteins. Glutamine is also crucial in nitrogen metabolism. Ammonia (formed by nitrogen fixation) is assimilated into organic compounds by converting glutamic acid to glutamine. The enzyme which accomplishes this is called glutamine synthetase. Glutamine can then be used as a nitrogen donor in the biosynthesis of many compounds, including other amino acids, purines, and pyrimidines.

L-glutamine improves nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) redox potential [FDA Label].","Supplemental L-glutamine's possible immunomodulatory role may be accounted for in a number of ways. L-glutamine appears to play a major role in protecting the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract and, in particular, the large intestine. During catabolic states, the integrity of the intestinal mucosa may be compromised with consequent increased intestinal permeability and translocation of Gram-negative bacteria from the large intestine into the body. The demand for L-glutamine by the intestine, as well as by cells such as lymphocytes, appears to be much greater than that supplied by skeletal muscle, the major storage tissue for L-glutamine. L-glutamine is the preferred respiratory fuel for enterocytes, colonocytes and lymphocytes. Therefore, supplying supplemental L-glutamine under these conditions may do a number of things. For one, it may reverse the catabolic state by sparing skeletal muscle L-glutamine. It also may inhibit translocation of Gram-negative bacteria from the large intestine. L-glutamine helps maintain secretory IgA, which functions primarily by preventing the attachment of bacteria to mucosal cells. L-glutamine appears to be required to support the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes, as well as the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). It is also required for the maintenance of lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK). L-glutamine can enhance phagocytosis by neutrophils and monocytes. It can lead to an increased synthesis of glutathione in the intestine, which may also play a role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosa by ameliorating oxidative stress. The exact mechanism of the possible immunomodulatory action of supplemental L-glutamine, however, remains unclear. It is conceivable that the major effect of L-glutamine occurs at the level of the intestine. Perhaps enteral L-glutamine acts directly on intestine-associated lymphoid tissue and stimulates overall immune function by that mechanism, without passing beyond the splanchnic bed.

The exact mechanism of L-glutamine's effect on NAD redox potential is unknown but is thought to involve increased amounts of reduced glutathione made available by glutamine supplementation [FDA Label]. This improvement in redox potential reduces the amount of oxidative damage which sickle red blood cells are more susceptible to. The reduction in cellular damage is thought to reduce chronic hemolysis and vaso-occlusive events.","Exogenous L-glutamine likely follows the same metabolic pathways as endogenous L-glutamine which is involved in the formation of glutamate, proteins, nucleotides, and amino acid sugars [FDA Label].","Absorption is efficient and occurs by an active transport mechanism.

It is produced in the body after series of conversion steps of 7-dehydrocholesterol from exposure to UV light. 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to [DB00169] (vitamin D3) in the skin, which is then converted to [DB00146] in the liver and kidneys. [DB00146] undergoes hydroxylation to form calcitriol via 1a-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) activity [A26353]. Calcitriol is considered to be the most potent metabolite of vitamin D in humans [A3366]. Renal production of calcitriol is stimulated in response to PTH, low calcium and low phosphate [A26353]. Calcitriol plays a role in plasma calcium regulation in concert with parathyroid hormone (PTH) by enhancing absorption of dietary calcium and phosphate from the gastrointestinal tract, promoting renal tubular reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys, and stimulating the release of calcium stores from the skeletal system. In addition to promoting fatty acid synthesis and inhibiting lipolysis, calcitriol has been demonstrated to increase energy efficiency by suppressing UCP2 expression, which is modulated by signaling pathways of classical nuclear receptors (nVDR), where calcitriol acts as a natural ligand [A175615]. There is also evidence that calcitriol modulates the action of cytokines and may regulate immune and inflammatory response, cell turnover, cell differentiation [A26353]. 

Administered orally and intravenously, calcitriol is commonly used as a medication in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism and resultant metabolic bone disease, hypocalcemia in patients undergoing chronic renal dialysis, and osteoporosis.

Its main sites of action are the intestine, bone, kidney and parathyroid hormone [FDA Label]. Calcitriol is a ligand for the vitamin D nuclear receptor, which is expressed in, but not limited to, gastrointestinal (GI) tissues, bones, and kidneys [A3366]. As an active form of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, calcitriol elevates the plasma levels of calcium by stimulating intestinal calcium uptake, increasing reabsorption of calcium by the kidneys, and possibly increasing the release of calcium from skeletal stores. The duration of pharmacologic activity of a single dose of exogenous calcitriol is expected to be about 3 to 5 days [FDA Label]. 

In addition to its important role in calcium metabolism, other pharmacological effects of calcitriol have been studied in various conditions including cancer models. Various studies demonstrated expression of vitamin D receptors in cancer cell lines, including mouse myeloid leukemia cells [A3366]. Calcitriol has been found to induce differentiation and/or inhibit cell proliferation _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ in many cell types, such as malignant cell lines carcinomas of the breast, prostate, colon, skin, and brain, myeloid leukemia cells, and others [A3367]. In early human prostate cancer trials, administration of 1.5 µg/d calcitriol in male participants resulted in a reduction in the rate of PSA rise in most participants, however it was coincided with dose-limiting hypercalcemia in most participants [A3366]. Hypercalcemia and hypercalcuria were evident in numerous initial trials, and this may be due to these trials not testing the drug at concentrations that are active in preclinical systems [A3367]. Findings from preclinical data show an additive or synergistic antineoplastic action of calcitriol when combined with agents including dexamethasone, retinoids, and radiation, as well as several cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs such as platinum compounds [A3367]. 

Vitamin D deficiency has long been suspected to increase the susceptibility to tuberculosis. The active form of calcitriol, 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>-D3, has been found to enhance the ability of mononuclear phagocytes to suppress the intracellular growth of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>-D3 has demonstrated beneficial effects in animal models of such autoimmune diseases as rheumatoid arthritis. Vitamin D appears to demonstrate both immune-enhancing and immunosuppressive effects.","The mechanism of action of calcitriol in the treatment of psoriasis is accounted for by their antiproliferative activity for keratinocytes and their stimulation of epidermal cell differentiation. The anticarcinogenic activity of the active form of Calcitriol appears to be correlated with cellular vitamin D receptor (VDR) levels. Vitamin D receptors belong to the superfamily of steroid-hormone zinc-finger receptors. VDRs selectively bind 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>-D3 and retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to form a heterodimeric complex that interacts with specific DNA sequences known as vitamin D-responsive elements. VDRs are ligand-activated transcription factors. The receptors activate or repress the transcription of target genes upon binding their respective ligands. It is thought that the anticarcinogenic effect of Calcitriol is mediated via VDRs in cancer cells. The immunomodulatory activity of calcitriol is thought to be mediated by vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are expressed constitutively in monocytes but induced upon activation of T and B lymphocytes. 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>-D3 has also been found to enhance the activity of some vitamin D-receptor positive immune cells and to enhance the sensitivity of certain target cells to various cytokines secreted by immune cells.

A study suggests that calcitriol plays an immunoregulatry role by suppressing the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) expression in human Th9, a pro-inflammatory CD4 T cell subset [A175747]. This suppression subsequently leads to repressed expression of BATF, a transcription factor essential for Th9 [A175747]. Calcitriol has also been found to induce monocyte differentiation and to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and production of cytokines, including interleukin IL-1 and IL-2, as well as to suppress immunoglobulin secretion by B lymphocytes.","Metabolism of calcitriol involves two pathways [FDA Label]. The first pathway involves 24-hydroxylase activity in the kidney; this enzyme is also present in many target tissues which possess the vitamin D receptor such as the intestine. The end product of this pathway is a side chain shortened metabolite, calcitroic acid. The second pathway involves the conversion of calcitriol via the stepwise hydroxylation of carbon-26 and carbon-23, and cyclization to yield ultimately 1a,25R(OH)<sub>2</sub>-26,23S-lactone D3, which appears to be the major metabolite circulating in humans.

Lutein is naturally present in the macula of the human retina. It filters out potentially phototoxic blue light and near-ultraviolet radiation from the macula. The protective effect is due in part, to the reactive oxygen species quenching ability of these carotenoids. Lutein is more stable to decomposition by pro-oxidants than are other carotenoids such as beta-carotene and lycopene. Lutein is abundant in the region surrounding the fovea, and lutein is the predominant pigment at the outermost periphery of the macula. Zeaxanthin, which is fully conjugated (lutein is not), may offer somewhat better protection than lutein against phototoxic damage caused by blue and near-ultraviolet light radiation. Lutein is one of only two carotenoids that have been identified in the human lens, may be protective against age-related increases in lens density and cataract formation. Again, the possible protection afforded by lutein may be accounted for, in part, by its reactive oxygen species scavenging abilities. Carotenoids also provide protection from cancer.

Biochemically, glucosamine is involved in glycoprotein metabolism. Glycoproteins, known as proteoglycans, form the ground substance in the extra-cellular matrix of connective tissue. Proteoglycans are polyanionic substances of high-molecular weight and contain many different types of heteropolysaccharide side-chains covalently linked to a polypeptide-chain backbone. These polysaccharides make up to 95% of the proteoglycan structure. In fact, chemically, proteoglycans resemble polysaccharides more than they do proteins. The polysaccharide groups in proteoglycans are called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs include hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, heparin and heparan sulfate. All of the GAGs contain derivatives of glucosamine or galactosamine. Glucosamine derivatives are found in hyaluronic acid, keratan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Chondroitin sulfate contains derivatives of galactosamine. The glucosamine-containing glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid is vital for the function of articular cartilage. GAG chains are fundamental components of aggrecan found in articular cartilage. Aggrecan confers upon articular cartilage shock-absorbing properties. It does this by providing cartilage with a swelling pressure that is restrained by the tensile forces of collagen fibers. This balance confers upon articular cartilage the deformable resilience vital to its function. In the early stages of degenerative joint disease, aggrecan biosynthesis is increased. However, in later stages, aggrecan synthesis is decreased, leading eventually to the loss of cartilage resiliency and to most of the symptoms that accompany osteoarthritis. During the progression of osteoarthritis, exogenous glucosamine may have a beneficial role. It is known that, in vitro, chondrocytes do synthesize more aggregan when the culture medium is supplemented with glucosamine. N-acetylglucosamine is found to be less effective in these in vitro studies. Glucosamine has also been found to have antioxidant activity and to be beneficial in animal models of experimental arthritis. The counter anion of the glucosamine salt (i.e. chloride or sulfate) is unlikely to play any role in the action or pharmacokinetics of glucosamine. Further, the sulfate in glucosamine sulfate supplements should not be confused with the glucosamine sulfate found in such GAGs as keratan sulfate and heparan sulfate. In the case of the supplement, sulfate is the anion of the salt. In the case of the above GAGs, sulfate is present as an ester.

The classical manifestations of vitamin D deficiency is rickets, which is seen in children and results in bony deformaties including bowed long bones. Deficiency in adults leads to the disease osteomalacia. Both rickets and osteomalacia reflect impaired mineralization of newly synthesized bone matrix, and usually result from a combination of inadequate exposure to sunlight and decreased dietary intake of vitamin D. Common causes of vitamin D deficiency include genetic defects in the vitamin D receptor, severe liver or kidney disease, and insufficient exposure to sunlight. Vitamin D plays an important role in maintaining calcium balance and in the regulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH).

Because this arrangement of carbon atoms cannot be made by humans, these amino acids are an essential element in the diet. The catabolism of all three compounds initiates in muscle and yields NADH and FADH2 which can be utilized for ATP generation. The catabolism of all three of these amino acids uses the same enzymes in the first two steps. The first step in each case is a transamination using a single BCAA aminotransferase, with a-ketoglutarate as amine acceptor. As a result, three different a-keto acids are produced and are oxidized using a common branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase, yielding the three different CoA derivatives. Subsequently the metabolic pathways diverge, producing many intermediates. The principal product from valine is propionylCoA, the glucogenic precursor of succinyl-CoA. Isoleucine catabolism terminates with production of acetylCoA and propionylCoA; thus isoleucine is both glucogenic and ketogenic. Leucine gives rise to acetylCoA and acetoacetylCoA, and is thus classified as strictly ketogenic. There are a number of genetic diseases associated with faulty catabolism of the BCAAs. The most common defect is in the branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase. Since there is only one dehydrogenase enzyme for all three amino acids, all three a-keto acids accumulate and are excreted in the urine.

As part of the minor metabolism, ergocalciferol is transformed into 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the liver by the activity of D-25-hydroxylase and CYP2R1.

L-arginine is in turn responsible for citrulline's therapeutic affects. Many of L-arginine's activities, including its possible anti-atherogenic actions, may be accounted for by its role as the precursor to nitric oxide or NO. NO is produced by all tissues of the body and plays very important roles in the cardiovascular system, immune system and nervous system. NO is formed from L-arginine via the enzyme nitric oxide synthase or synthetase (NOS), and the effects of NO are mainly mediated by 3',5' -cyclic guanylate or cyclic GMP. NO activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP from guanosine triphosphate or GTP. Cyclic GMP is converted to guanylic acid via the enzyme cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. <br/><br/>NOS is a heme-containing enzyme with some sequences similar to cytochrome P-450 reductase. Several isoforms of NOS exist, two of which are constitutive and one of which is inducible by immunological stimuli. The constitutive NOS found in the vascular endothelium is designated eNOS and that present in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system is designated nNOS. The form of NOS induced by immunological or inflammatory stimuli is known as iNOS. iNOS may be expressed constitutively in select tissues such as lung epithelium. <br/><br/>All the nitric oxide synthases use NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) as cosubstrates, as well as the cofactors FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), FMN (flavin mononucleotide), tetrahydrobiopterin and heme.

More specifically, Folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. For example, folic acid is present in green vegetables, beans, avocado, and some fruits [L5744].

In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF. When used in high doses such as for cancer therapy, or in low doses such as for Rheumatoid Arthritis or psoriasis, [DB00563] impedes the body's ability to create folic acid. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects. As a result, supplementation with 1-5mg of folic acid is recommended to prevent deficiency and a number of side effects associated with MTX therapy including mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal irritation. [DB00650] (also known as folinic acid) supplementation is typically used for high-dose MTX regimens for the treatment of cancer. Levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), and are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF.

There are also several antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that are associated with reduced serum and red blood cell folate, including [DB00564] (CBZ), [DB00252] (PHT), or barbiturates [A37004]. Folic acid is therefore often provided as supplementation to individuals using these medications, particularly to women of child-bearing age. 

Inadequate folate levels can result in a number of health concerns including cardiovascular disease, megaloblastic anemias, cognitive deficiencies, and neural tube defects (NTDs).

Both 20-carbon omega-6 fatty acids (arachidonic acid) and 20-carbon omega-3 fatty acids (EPA) can be found in cell membranes. During an inflammatory response, arachidonic acid and EPA are metabolized by enzymes known as cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases to form eicosanoids. Increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake increases the EPA content of cell membranes and decreases the arachidonic acid content, resulting in higher proportions of eicosanoids derived from EPA. Physiologic responses to arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids differ from responses to EPA-derived eicosanoids. In general, eicosanoids derived from EPA are less potent inducers of inflammation, blood vessel constriction, and clotting than eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid.","The anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and immunomodulatory actions of EPA is probably due to its role in eicosanoid physiology and biochemistry.

The catabolism of all three of these amino acids uses the same enzymes in the first two steps. The first step in each case is a transamination using a single BCAA aminotransferase, with a-ketoglutarate as amine acceptor. As a result, three different a-keto acids are produced and are oxidized using a common branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase, yielding the three different CoA derivatives. Subsequently the metabolic pathways diverge, producing many intermediates. <br/>The principal product from valine is propionylCoA, the glucogenic precursor of succinyl-CoA.

Vitamin B6, principally in its biologically active coenzyme form pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, is involved in a wide range of biochemical reactions, including the metabolism of amino acids and glycogen, the synthesis of nucleic acids, hemogloblin, sphingomyelin and other sphingolipids, and the synthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [A32837].

Vitamin B6 has been found to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a small group of subjects with essential hypertension. Hypertension is another risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Another study showed pyridoxine hydrochloride to inhibit ADP- or epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation and to lower total cholesterol levels and increase HDL-cholesterol levels, again in a small group of subjects. Vitamin B6, in the form of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, was found to protect vascular endothelial cells in culture from injury by activated platelets. Endothelial injury and dysfunction are critical initiating events in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Human studies have demonstrated that vitamin B6 deficiency affects cellular and humoral responses of the immune system. Vitamin B6 deficiency results in altered lymphocyte differentiation and maturation, reduced delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses, impaired antibody production, decreased lymphocyte proliferation and decreased interleukin (IL)-2 production, among other immunologic activities.","Vitamin B6 is the collective term for a group of three related compounds, pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxal (PL) and pyridoxamine (PM), and their phosphorylated derivatives, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP), pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP).

In the blood stream, another chelator such as dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is used to transfer mercury safely into the urine for excretion.

Because this arrangement of carbon atoms cannot be made by humans, these amino acids are an essential element in the diet. The catabolism of all three compounds initiates in muscle and yields NADH and FADH2 which can be utilized for ATP generation. The catabolism of all three of these amino acids uses the same enzymes in the first two steps. The first step in each case is a transamination using a single BCAA aminotransferase, with a-ketoglutarate as amine acceptor. As a result, three different a-keto acids are produced and are oxidized using a common branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase, yielding the three different CoA derivatives. Subsequently the metabolic pathways diverge, producing many intermediates. <br/>The principal product from valine is propionylCoA, the glucogenic precursor of succinyl-CoA. Isoleucine catabolism terminates with production of acetylCoA and propionylCoA; thus isoleucine is both glucogenic and ketogenic.

The most common defect is in the branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase.

Both the endogenous form of vitamin D (that results from 7-dehydrocholesterol transformation), vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), and the plant-derived form, vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), are considered the main forms of vitamin d and are found in various types of food for daily intake [L5689]. Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 [L5689]. Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use [L5689].

Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048]. However, studies are also ongoing to determine whether or not cholecalciferol may also play certain roles in cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, and other medical conditions that may be associated with vitamin D deficiency [L5689].","67-97-0","1C6V77QF41",384.6377,384.33921603,"solid",2,7,1,3,"Jean Jolly, Primo Rizzi, Jean Taillardat, ""1.alpha.,25.alpha.-Dihydroxy-cholecalciferol and methods for the production thereof."" U.S. Patent US4435325, issued May, 1977.","Cholecalciferol use is indicated for the treatment of specific medical conditions like refractory rickets (or vitamin D resistant rickets), hypoparathyroidism, and familial hypophosphatemia [F4027, F4042].

Concurrently, as one of the most commonly utilized forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol is also very frequently used as a supplement in individuals to maintain sufficient vitamin d levels in the body or to treat vitamin D deficiency, as well as various medical conditions that can be associated directly or indirectly with vitamin d insufficiency like osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease, among others [A176041, A176044, F4051].","The in vivo synthesis of the predominant two biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first hydroxylation of vitamin D3 cholecalciferol (or D2) occurs in the liver to yield 25-hydroxyvitamin D while the second hydroxylation happens in the kidneys to give 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [F4027, F4042, F4048]. These vitamin D metabolites subsequently facilitate the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the small intestine, serving to increase serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to allow bone mineralization [F4027, F4042, F4048]. Conversely, these vitamin D metabolites also assist in mobilizing calcium and phosphate from bone and likely increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate via the renal tubules [F4027, F4042, F4048]. There exists a period of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of cholecalciferol and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active vitamin D metabolites in the liver and kidneys [F4027, F4042, F4048]. It is parathyroid hormone that is responsible for the regulation of such metabolism at the level of the kidneys [F4027, F4042, F4048].","Most individuals naturally generate adequate amounts of vitamin D through ordinary dietary intake of vitamin D (in some foods like eggs, fish, and cheese) and natural photochemical conversion of the vitamin D3 precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin via exposure to sunlight [L5689, F4027, F4042, F4048].

Conversely, vitamin D deficiency can often occur from a combination of insufficient exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake of vitamin D, genetic defects with endogenous vitamin D receptor, or even severe liver or kidney disease [A243]. Such deficiency is known for resulting in conditions like rickets or osteomalacia, all of which reflect inadequate mineralization of bone, enhanced compensatory skeletal demineralization, resultant decreased calcium ion blood concentrations, and increases in the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone [A223]. Increases in parathyroid hormone stimulate the mobilization of skeletal calcium and the renal excretion of phosphorus [A223]. This enhanced mobilization of skeletal calcium leads towards porotic bone conditions [A223].

Ordinarily, while vitamin D3 is made naturally via photochemical processes in the skin, both itself and vitamin D2 can be found in various food and pharmaceutical sources as dietary supplements. The principal biological function of vitamin D is the maintenance of normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus in the bloodstream by enhancing the efficacy of the small intestine to absorb these minerals from the diet [A223]. At the liver, vitamin D3 or D2 is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and then finally to the primary active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidney via further hydroxylation [A223, A243]. This final metabolite binds to endogenous vitamin d receptors, which results in a variety of regulatory roles - including maintaining  calcium balance, the regulation of parathyroid hormone, the promotion of the renal reabsorption of calcium, increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increased calcium and phosphorus mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from bone to plasma to maintain balanced levels of each in bone and the plasma [A223, A243].

In particular, calcitriol interacts with vitamin D receptors in the small intestine to enhance the efficiency of intestinal calcium and phosphorous absorption from about 10-15% to 30-40% and 60% increased to 80%, respectively [L5689]. Furthermore, calcitriol binds with vitamin D receptors in osteoblasts to stimulate a receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (or RANKL) which subsequently interacts with receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (NFkB) on immature preosteoclasts, causing them to become mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts [L5689]. Such mature osteoclasts ultimately function in removing calcium and phosphorus from bone to maintain blood calcium and phosphorus levels [L5689]. Moreover, calcitriol also stimulates calcium reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate in the kidneys [L5689].

Additionally, it is believed that when calcitriol binds with nuclear vitamin D receptors, that this bound complex itself binds to retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to generate a heterodimeric complex that consequently binds to specific nucleotide sequences in the DNA called vitamin D response elements [L5689]. When bound, various transcription factors attach to this complex, resulting in either up or down-regulation of the associated gene's activity. It is thought that there may be as much as 200 to 2000 genes that possess vitamin D response elements or that are influenced indirectly to control a multitude of genes across the genome [L5689].  It is in this way that cholecalciferol is believed to function in regulating gene transcription associated with cancer risk, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular disease linked to vitamin D deficiency [L5689]. In fact, there has been some research to suggest calcitriol may also be able to prevent malignancies by inducing cellular maturation and inducing apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis, exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting foam cell formation and promoting angiogenesis in endothelial colony-forming cells in vitro, inhibit immune reactions by enhancing the transcription of endogenous antibiotics like cathelicidin and regulate the activity and differentiation of CD4+ T cells, amongst a variety of other proposed actions [L5689].","Within the liver, cholecalciferol is hydroxylated to calcifediol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol) by the enzyme vitamin D-25-hydroxylase [F4027, F4042, F4048]. At the kidney, calcifediol subsequently serves as a substrate for 1-alpha-hydroxylase, yielding calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol), the biologically active form of vitamin D3 [F4027, F4042, F4048].","Cholecalciferol is readily absorbed from the small intestine if fat absorption is normal [F4027, F4042, F4048]. Moreover, bile is necessary for absorption as well [F4027, F4042, F4048].

In particular, recent studies have determined aspects about the absorption of vitamin D, like the fact that a) the 25-hydroxyvitamin D metabolite of cholecalciferol is absorbed to a greater extent than the nonhydroxy form of cholecalciferol, b) the quantity of fat with which cholecalciferol is ingested does not appear to largely affect its bioavailability, and c) age does not apparently effect vitamin D cholecalciferol [A176447].","At this time, there have been resources that document the half-life of cholecalciferol as being about 50 days [T527] while other sources have noted that the half-life of calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) is approximately 15 hours while that of calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D3) is about 15 days [L1782].

Moreover, it appears that the half-lives of any particular administration of vitamin d can vary due to variations in vitamin d binding protein concentrations and genotype in particular individuals [A32185].","The protein binding documented for cholecalciferol is 50 to 80% [T527]. Specifically, in the plasma, vitamin D3 (from either diet or the skin) is bound to vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) produced in the liver, for transport to the liver. Ultimately, the form of vitamin D3 reaching the liver is 25-hydroxylated, and such 25-hydroxycholecalciferol is bound to DBP (a2-globulin) whilst circulating in the plasma [F4048].","It has been observed that administered cholecalciferol and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the bile and feces [T527].","Studies have determined that the mean central volume of distribution of administered cholecalciferol supplementation in a group of 49 kidney transplant patients was approximately 237 L [A176417].","Studies have determined that the mean clearance value of administered cholecalciferol supplementation in a group of 49 kidney transplant patients was approximately 2.5 L/day [A176417].","Delta-DMicro-DOptimal-DRV Nutritional, LLCVigantol",0,NA,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00169.pdf?1265922737",0,780,"Chronic or acute administration of excessive doses of cholecalciferol may lead to hypervitaminosis D, manifested by hypercalcemia and its sequelae [F4027, F4042, F4048].

Later and possibly more serious manifestation include nephrocalcinosis, renal dysfunction, osteoporosis in adults, impaired growth in children, anemia, metastatic calcification, pancreatitis, generalized vascular calcification, and seizures [F4027, F4042, F4048].

Safety of doses in excess of 400 IU (10mcg) of vitamin D3 daily during pregnancy has not been established [F4027, F4042, F4048]. Maternal hypercalcemia, possibly caused by excessive vitamin D intake during pregnancy, has been associated with hypercalcemia in neonates, which may lead to supravalvular aortic stenosis syndrome, the features of which may include retinopathy, mental or growth retardation, strabismus, and other effects [F4027, F4042, F4048]. Hypercalcemia during pregnancy may also lead to suppression of parathyroid hormone release in the neonate, resulting in hypocalcemia, tetany, and seizures [F4027, F4042, F4048].

Vitamin D is deficient in maternal milk; therefore, breastfed infants may require supplementation. Use of excessive amounts of Vitamin D in nursing mothers may result in hypercalcemia in infants. Doses of Vitamin D3 in excess of 10 µg daily should not be administered daily to nursing women."

Newborns that are administered too great a dosage of vitamin K3 can suffer from kernicterus, a form of severe brain damage that may produce decreased movement, loss of appetite, seizures, deafness, mental retardation, and even death.

 Valsartan is indicated for the management of hypertension in patients for whom combination therapy is deemed appropriate [F3139]. It is combined with other anthypertensive agents such as hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, nevibolol and sacubitril [F3139], [F3136], [F3145], [F3148].

**Heart Failure**

Valsartan is indicated for the treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) in patients who are intolerant to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) for various reasons, including those who experience ACE inhibitor adverse effects.  In a clinical study of 5010 patients, hospitalizations due to heart failure were markedly decreased when valsartan was taken regularly over a 2-year span [FDA label].


","Valsartan inhibits the pressor effect of an angiotensin II hormone, decreasing blood pressure [F3139].  

Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I during a reaction that is catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme, also known as _ACE_ . Angiotensin II is the main pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, causing vasoconstriction, aldosterone synthesis and release, cardiac stimulation, as well as the renal reabsorption of sodium [FDA label].

The cardioprotective benefits of valsartan have been shown in large-scale clinical outcomes trials and include significant decreases in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in heart failure, after myocardial infarction, and in patients with comorbid hypertension and coronary artery disease and/or heart failure; reductions in heart failure hospitalizations; and reductions in stroke incidence [FDA label], [A174124]. 

This drug has been shown to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects  [A174157], [A174160], [A174163]. Improvements in chronic kidney disease with valsartan include both clinically and statistically significant decreases in urinary albumin and protein excretion in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and in nondiabetic patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease [A174124].","Valsartan selectively acts on _AT1_, the subtype receptor that mediates the cardiovascular actions of angiotensin II, the main vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin-system. The _AT2_ receptor subtype, which can be found in tissues such as the brain, endometrium, myometrium, and fetal kidney and adrenals, plays no known role in cardiovascular homeostasis at this time [F3139].

Angiotensin II contributes to vasoconstrictor activity and sodium/water retention, which contribute to hypertension.  Through the inhibition of response to angiotensin II by actions on the _AT1_ receptor, valsartan is able to decrease blood pressure [FDA label].

The cardioprotective effects of valsartan are thought to occur through inverse agonist activity of valsartan on the _AT1_ receptor, which plays an important role in cardiac remodeling (causing ventricular hypertrophy).  Inverse agonists such as valsartan inactivate this receptor, preventing cardiovascular remodeling [A174154].","This drug undergoes minimal liver metabolism [A174124]. Valsartan is not biotransformed to a high degree, as only approximately 20% of a single dose is recovered as metabolites. A hydroxyl metabolite has been found in plasma at low concentrations (less than 10% of the valsartan area under the curve). This metabolite is inactive [F3139].
","Absolute bioavailability for valsartan is approximately 25% (ranges between 10%-35%). The bioavailability of the suspension is 1.6 times higher than that of the oral tablet. With the tablet, food decreases the exposure to valsartan by approximately 40% and peak plasma concentration by approximately 50%. AUC and Cmax values of valsartan genereally increase linearly with increasing dose over the therapeutic dose range. Valsartan does not accumulate appreciably in plasma following repetitive administration [FDA label].

After one oral dose, the antihypertensive activity of valsartan begins within approximately 2 hours and peaks within 4-6 hours in most patients [F3139].","After intravenous (IV) administration, valsartan demonstrates bi-exponential decay kinetics (t1/2a <1 hour and t1/2ß between 5-9 hours) [F3139].","94 - 97% bound to serum proteins, primarily serum albumin [F3139].

[T116]","Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor similar to benazepril, fosinopril and quinapril. [T116] It is an inactive prodrug that is converted to ramiprilat in the liver, the main site of activation, and kidneys. Ramiprilat confers blood pressure lowing effects by antagonizing the effect of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain the effects of ramiprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.","Ramipril inhibits the RAAS system by binding to and inhibiting ACE thereby preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. [T116] As plasma levels of angiotensin II fall, less activation of the G-protein coupled receptors angiotensin receptor I (AT<sub>1</sub>R) and angiotensin receptor II (AT<sub>2</sub>R) occurs. 

AT<sub>1</sub>R mediates vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress through a variety of signaling pathways. [T116] These include G<sub>q</sub> coupling to the inositol triphosphate pathway, activation of phospholipases C, A<sub>2</sub>, and D which contribute to eicosanoid production, activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and MAP kinases, G<sub>i</sub> and G<sub>12/13</sub>, and eventual activation of the Jak/STAT pathway leading to cell growth and production of extracellular matrix components. AT<sub>1</sub>R activation also leads to increased activity of membrane-bound NADH/NADPH oxidase which contributes to production of reactive oxygen species. Decreased activation of this receptor mediates the renoprotective, antihypertensive, and cardioprotective effects of ramipril by reducing inflammation and vasoconstriction.

AT<sub>2</sub>R acts in opposition to the effects of AT<sub>1</sub>R by activating phosphotyrosine phosphatases which inhibit MAP kinases, inhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel opening, and stimulating cGMP and nitric oxide production leading to vasodilation. [T116] These counteracting effects are shared by the Mas receptor which is activated by Ang(1-7), a subtype of angiotensin produced by plasma esterases from AngI or by ACE2 from AngII produced through a secondary pathway by tonin and cathepsin G. Ang(1-7) also activates AT<sub>2</sub>R although the bulk of its effect is mediated by MasR.

ACE is also responsible for the breakdown of bradykinin. [T116] The resulting buildup of bradykinin due to ACE inhibition is thought to mediate the characteristic dry-cough as a side effect of ACE inhibitor medications.

Patients receiving this drug should have reversible spasticity for baclofen to promote the restoration of residual function. This drug is not indicated in the treatment of skeletal muscle spasm caused by rheumatic disorders. The efficacy of baclofen in stroke, cerebral palsy, and Parkinson's disease has not been determined and, therefore, baclofen is not recommended for these conditions [FDA label].
","In neurological diseases associated with spasm of the skeletal muscles, the clinical effects of baclofen occur due to baclofen action on reflex muscle contractions and of significant relief from painful spasm, automatism, as well as clonus. Baclofen, when used as indicated, improves mobility, increasing levels of independence, and facilitates both passive and active physiotherapy. Baclofen also stimulates gastric acid secretion [F2980].

GABA-B receptor activation by baclofen may produce protective neurological effects. Baclofen also possesses anti-inflammatory properties that may be of interest in the study of addiction treatment [A173938]. Preclinical studies have shown that GABA-B receptors have roles in memory storage and retrieval, reward, motivation, mood, as well as anxiety. Neuroimaging studies in humans indicate that baclofen produces region-specific alterations in brain activity.","The exact mechanism of action of baclofen is not fully understood at this time [FDA label], [F2983]. Many studies indicate that baclofen is a GABA-B receptor agonist [A254], [A25184], [A173923], [A173926], [A173929]. Despite this, there is no conclusive evidence that the effects of baclofen on GABA systems are involved in the production of its clinical effects [FDA label].   

Baclofen is an effective and widely used antispastic agent with a spinal site of action. Its mechanism of action and pharmacological properties are different from the effects of other antispastic agents. In addition, baclofen has central sites of action, shown by its adverse event profile and general CNS depressant properties [F2980]. GABA-B receptors interact with signal transduction pathways and neurotransmitter systems. Baclofen exerts an antinociceptive effect. The clinical significance of this warrants further research data for clarification. 

Baclofen depresses monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflex transmission, by various actions, and possibly including the stimulation of GABAß-receptors. This stimulation results in the inhibition of excitatory neurotransmitter (glutamate and aspartate) release, which may normally contribute to pain and spasticity[F2980]. Although baclofen is an analog of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA), there are no conclusive data indicating GABA systems are involved in its clinical effects [FDA label].","Approximately 15% of the dose is metabolized in the liver, mainly by deamination [FDA label].

It was previously used for a large variety of conditions and this changed until this point where its use is highly restricted. Amphetamine, with the chemical formula alpha-methylphenethylamine, was discovered in 1910 and first synthesized by 1927. After being proven to reduce drug-induced anesthesia and produce arousal and insomnia, amphetamine racemic mix was registered by Smith, Kline and French in 1935. Amphetamine structure presents one chiral center and it exists in the form of dextro- and levo-isomers.[A18540] The first product of Smith, Kline and French was approved by the FDA on 1976.[L5194]

During World War II, amphetamine was used to promote wakefulness in the soldiers. This use derived into a large overproduction of amphetamine and all the surplus after the war finalized ended up in the black market, producing the initiation of the illicit abuse.[A18540]","300-62-9","CK833KGX7E",135.2062,135.104799421,"liquid",3,11,0,5,"Guohong Wang, ""Composition and methods for synthesis of novel tracers for detecting amphetamine and methamphetamine in samples.""

ADHD is a complex disorder associated with the substantial heterogeneity in etiology, clinical presentation, and treatment outcome. ADHD comes from a complex interplay between interdependent genetic and non-genetic factors which cause complex mental disorders in children and teenagers.[A174271]

On the other hand, narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder typically resenting during adolescence and characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness.[A174274]

Amphetamine is also being used nowadays off-label for the treatment of obesity, depression and chronic pain.[A174268, A174283]","From its mechanism of action, it has been demonstrated that amphetamine augments the concentration of noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex and dopamine in the striatum on a dose and time-dependent manner. The indistinct release of neurotransmitters which include adrenaline is known to produce cardiovascular side effects.[A174214] 

There are old reports of a cognitive enhancement related to the administration of amphetamine in which improvements in intelligence test scores were reported.[A174196]

In ADHD, amphetamine has been largely showed to produce remarkable improvements in school performance, behavior, and demeanor.[A18540] The effect was shown to be produced through both racemic forms and to this date, the use of racemic forms 3:1 (D:L) is very common.[A174199] The therapeutic effect of amphetamine on serotonin does not seem to have a significant clinical effect on ADHD as observed on comparative studies with amphetamine and fenfluramine, a powerful serotonin releasing factor. However, the indirect effect on serotonin might have an effect on the depression and anxiety profile of ADHD.[A174241]

Studies regarding the illicit use of amphetamine in which heavy consumers were studied proved the generation of a paranoid state which flagged this drug as a psychiatric danger compound.[L5197] This observation was supported by the continuous reports of misuse in patients under depression.[A18540]","It is important to consider that amphetamine has a very similar structure to the catecholamine neurotransmitters mainly on the presence of a long planar conformation, the presence of an aromatic ring and nitrogen in the aryl side chain. Amphetamine, as well as other catecholamines, is taken into presynaptic nerve terminals by the association with two sodium ions and one chloride ion. The complex of the amphetamine with the ions is actively transported by monoamine reuptake transporters. As amphetamine acts competitively with the endogenous monoamines, the greater the number of amphetamines the more internalized amphetamine will be found.[A18540]

Once inside the presynaptic terminal, amphetamine displaces other monoamines to be stored by VMAT2 which produces the pumping of the neurotransmitters into the synapse by a process called retro-transport.[A174211] This process of release of neurotransmitters is approximately fourfold more potent in the d-isomer for the release of dopamine.[A174214]

The mechanism of action of amphetamine is complemented by the inhibition of the reuptake and of monoamine oxidase which acts synergistically to produce a significant increase the monoamine concentration.[A18540] This activity is not done as an inhibitor per se but more as a competitive substrate and thus, amphetamine is known to be a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor, moderate noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor and very weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor. From this specific action, the l-isomer is known to be significantly less potent.[A174214]

Lastly, amphetamine is known to be an inhibitor of the mitochondrial-bound enzyme MAO which is the catalytic enzyme in charge of degrading all the excess of neurotransmitters. This mechanism of action is often overpassed as amphetamine is a weak MAO inhibitor but this mechanism cannot be dismissed.[A18540]","Amphetamine is known to be metabolized by the liver under the action of the CYP2D6. The metabolic pathway of amphetamine is mainly defined by aromatic hydroxylation, aliphatic hydroxylation, and n-dealkylation.[L5212] The formed metabolites in this pathway are 4-hydroxyamphetamine, 4-hydroxynorephedrine, hippuric acid, benzoic acid, benzyl methyl ketone, and p-hydroxyamphetamine which is known to be a potent hallucinogen.[L5206] However, a significant part of the original compound remains unchanged.[A174292]","Amphetamine is well absorbed in the gut and as it is a weak base hence the more basic the environment the more of the drug is found in a lipid-soluble form and the absorption through lipid-rich cell membranes is highly favored.[A174292] The peak response of amphetamine occurs 1-3 hours after oral administration and approximately 15 minutes after injection and it presents a bioavailability of over 75%.[L5206] Complete amphetamine absorption is usually done after 4-6 hours.[L5209]","The half-life of amphetamine highly depends on the isomer. For d-amphetamine, the reported half-life is of approximately 9-11 hours while for l-amphetamine the half-life is reported to be of 11-14 hours. The urine pH can modify this pharmacokinetic parameter which can vary from 7 hours in acid urine to 34 hours for alkaline urine.[A174292]","The reported protein binding of amphetamine is relatively low and register to be of 20%.[A174292]","The elimination of amphetamine is mainly via the urine from which about 40% of the excreted dose is found as unchanged amphetamine. About 90% of the administered amphetamine is eliminated 3 days after oral administration.[A174292] The rate of elimination of amphetamine highly depends on the urine pH in which acidic pH will produce a higher excretion of amphetamine and basic pH produces a lower excretion.[L5206]","Amphetamine is reported to have a high volume of distribution of 4 L/kg.[A174292]","The reported normal clearance rate is of 0.7 L.h/kg.

The M3 receptors are found on smooth muscles and in many glands which help to stimulate secretion in salivary glands, and their activation generally results in smooth muscle contraction and increased glandular secretions.

As an off-label indication, tramadol has been investigated to be used for the treatment of premature ejaculation.[A173986]","Tramadol inhibits the descending pain pathways at the spinal level.[A173983] There are reports supporting the fact that tramadol activity goes beyond the inhibition of opioid receptors. In this reports the administration of [naloxone] only reduced the activity of tramadol by 30%. Those reports also indicate that the inhibition of metabolic enzymes, used for the generation of M1 which has a very high affinity for opioids, does not affect tramadol-induced analgesia.[A174007]

The inhibition of neurotransmitters by both tramadol enantiomers has been shown to enhance the inhibitory descending pathways associated with pain transmission in the CNS.[A173980] At the same time, it presents local anesthetic properties by blocking potassium channels[A173983] and its secondary mechanisms of action are thought to increase the activity of endogenous inhibitory control and decrease pain transmission which would explain the central analgesic effects of tramadol.[A173989]

From the racemic form, the (+)-tramadol seems to be more effective but less tolerated if administered alone. This indicates the importance of having the racemic mix in order to have the most optimal results. The effect of this racemic mix is compared to be of about 20% of the effect of morphine.[L5128]","Tramadol has a dual action of pain relief by acting as both a central opiate agonist and a central nervous system reuptake inhibitor of norepinephrine and serotonin. (+)-Tramadol and its O-desmethyl metabolite (M1) are selective and weak mu receptor agonist which in order, alter the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters. From these two molecules, the metabolite M1 metabolite has 300 times more affinity for this receptor while (+)-tramadol also inhibits serotonin reuptake. On the other hand, (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake.[A173980] 

Other than this major mechanism of action, tramadol is known and fully studied due to its inhibitory activity against alpha2-adrenoreceptors, neurokinin 1 receptors, and muscarinic receptors as well as the inhibition of ion channels via nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.[A173989]","Tramadol undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver by N- and O- demethylation and conjugation. From the extensive metabolism, there have been identified at least 23 metabolites. The main metabolic pathways are marked by two pathways; the first one, marked by the generation of O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1), which is pharmacologically active, is catalyzed by CYP2D6 while CYP3A4 and while the second pathway, performed by CYP2B6 facilitates the biotransformation of tramadol to N-desmethyl-tramadol.[A173980]

**A note on laboratory testing**

Obtaining specimens for fungal culture and other important laboratory studies such as serology or pathology is advised before starting fluconazole therapy in order to isolate the organisms to be eliminated through treatment. It is permissible to start therapy before the results are available, however, adjusting the therapy once laboratory results confirm the causative organism may be necessary.[FDA label]
","Fluconazole has been demonstrated to show fungistatic activity against the majority of strains of the following microorganisms, curing fungal infections[FDA label]:

_Candida albicans, Candida glabrata (Many strains are intermediately susceptible), Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans_

This is achieved through steroidal inhibition in fungal cells, interfering with cell wall synthesis and growth as well as cell adhesion, thereby treating fungal infections and their symptoms.[FDA label,A174325,A174343]

The fungistatic activity of fluconazole has also been shown in normal and immunocompromised animal models with both systemic and intracranial fungal infections caused by _Cryptococcus neoformans_ and for systemic infections caused by Candida albicans.[FDA label]  It is important to note that resistant organisms have been found against various strains of organisms treated with fluconazole.[A178759,A178762,A178765] This further substantiates the need to perform susceptibility testing when fluconazole is considered as an antifungal therapy.[A178768,A178786] 


**A note on steroidal effects of fluconazole**

There has been some concern that fluconazole may interfere with and inactivate human steroids/hormones due to the inhibition of hepatic cytochrome enzymes.[L6496]  Fluconazole has demonstrated to be more selective for _fungal_ cytochrome P-450 enzymes than for a variety of mammalian cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Fluconazole 50 mg administered daily for up to 28 days in individuals of reproductive age has been show to have no effect on testosterone plasma concentrations of males and plasma concentrations of steroids in females. A 200-400 mg dose of fluconazole showed no clinically relevant effect on steroid levels or on ACTH-stimulated steroid response in healthy males, in one clinical study mentioned on the European Medicines Agency label.[L6496] Other studies have shown no significant effects of fluconazole on steroid levels, further confirming these data.[A174358,A178780]","Fluconazole is a very selective inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P450 dependent enzyme _lanosterol 14-a-demethylase_. This enzyme normally works to convert _lanosterol_ to _ergosterol_, which is necessary for fungal cell wall synthesis.  The free nitrogen atom located on the azole ring of fluconazole binds with a single iron atom located in the heme group of lanosterol 14-a-demethylase.[A178774] This prevents oxygen activation and, as a result, inhibits the demethylation of lanosterol, halting the process of ergosterol biosynthesis.[A178777]  Methylated sterols are then found to accumulate in the fungal cellular membrane, leading to an arrest of fungal growth.[A178774] These accumulated sterols negatively affect the structure and function of the fungal cell plasma membrane.[A16632]

Fluconazole resistance may arise from an alteration in the amount or function of the target enzyme (lanosterol 14-a-demethylase), altered access to this enzyme, or a combination of the above.[A16632] Other mechanisms may also be implicated, and studies are ongoing.[A178783]","Fluconazole is metabolized minimally in the liver.  Fluconazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and CYP2C19.[L6496,FDA label] Two metabolites were detected in the urine of healthy volunteers taking a 50 mg radiolabeled dose of fluconazole; a glucuronidated metabolite on the hydroxyl moiety (6.5%) and a fluconazole N-oxide metabolite (2%).[A178813] The same study indicated that no signs of metabolic cleavage of fluconazole were observed, suggesting a difference in metabolism when compared to other agents in the same drug class, which are heavily metabolized in the liver.[A178813,A178834]","The pharmacokinetic properties of fluconazole are comparable after administration by the intravenous (IV) and oral (PO) routes. In healthy volunteers, the bioavailability of orally administered fluconazole is measured to be above 90%.[FDA label] It is extensively absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract when an oral dose is taken.[A178813] Oral absorption is not affected by food intake with fluconazole but may increase the time until the maximum concentration is reached.[L6496,A178792]

Tmax (or the time taken to achieve the maximum concentration) in one clinical study of healthy patients receiving 50 mg/kg of fluconazole was 3 hours.[A178792] 

Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) in fasting and healthy volunteers occur between 1-2 hours post-dose.[FDA label] Steady-state concentrations are achieved within 5 to 10 days after oral doses of 50-400 mg administered once daily. Administration of a loading dose on the first day of fluconazole treatment,  or twice the usual daily dose, leads to plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day.[FDA label] Mean AUC (area under the curve) was 20.3 in healthy volunteers receiving 25 mg of fluconazole.[A178792]

**A note on the capsule and powder form and malabsorption syndromes**

The capsule forms of fluconazole often contain lactose and should not be administered with hereditary galactose intolerance, _Lapp lactase enzyme_ deficiency, or malabsorption of glucose/galactose.[FDA label] The powder form, used for the oral suspension, lists sucrose as an ingredient and should not be used in patients who have been diagnosed with fructose, glucose/galactose malabsorption, and _sucrase-isomaltase_ enzyme deficiency.[FDA label]","The terminal elimination half-life in the plasma is approximately 30 hours (range: 20-50 hours) after oral administration.[FDA label]
The long plasma elimination half-life supports a single dose therapy for vaginal candidiasis, once daily and once weekly dosing for other indications.[L6496]. Patients with renal failure may require dosage adjustment, and half-life can be significantly increased in these patients.[A178792]
","The protein binding of fluconazole is low and estimated to be 11 to 12%.[FDA label,A178792]","In normal volunteers, fluconazole is cleared primarily by renal excretion, with approximately 80% of the administered dose measured in the urine as unchanged drug.[FDA label] About 11% of the dose is excreted in the urine as metabolites.[FDA label]. A study of a 50mg radiolabeled dose of fluconazole revealed that 93.3% of the dose was found excreted in the urine.[A178813]

**A note on renal failure**

The pharmacokinetics of fluconazole are significantly affected by renal dysfunction. The dose of fluconazole may need to be reduced in patients with decreased renal function. A 3-hour hemodialysis treatment lowers plasma fluconazole concentrations by about 50%.[FDA label]
","The apparent volume of distribution is said to be similar to the volume of distribution of total body water.[FDA label] One clinical study of healthy volunteers administered 50 mg/kg of fluconazole was 39L, based on a body weight of 60kg.[A178792]

Fluconazole shows substantial penetration in many body fluids, which is a property that renders it an ideal treatment for systemic fungal infections, especially when administered over a longer time.[A178792,FDA label] Fluconazole is found in high concentrations in the stratum corneum and dermis-epidermis of skin, in addition to eccrine sweat. Fluconazole is found to accumulate especially well in the stratum corneum, which is beneficial in superficial fungal infections.[L6496] Saliva and sputum concentrations of fluconazole are found to be similar to the plasma concentrations.[L6505] In patients diagnosed with fungal meningitis, fluconazole CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) levels are measured to be about  80% of the corresponding plasma levels. Therefore, fluconazole crosses the blood-brain barrier[L6496].  The meninges are increasingly permeable to fluconazole in states of inflammation, facilitating treatment in meningitis.[A178801]

**A note on liver toxicity**

The FDA label warns that this drug carries a risk of hepatotoxicity. Rare but serious cases of serious hepatic toxicity have been reported, especially in patients with serious underlying medical conditions using fluconazole.  This group of patients has an increased risk of fatality when using fluconazole.[FDA label]  In patients with existing liver dysfunction, use caution during fluconazole therapy. Those who are found to have abnormal liver function tests during therapy should be carefully monitored for the development of increasingly severe injury to the liver. Fluconazole should be stopped if its use is likely to be the underlying cause of liver injury, and medical attention should be sought.[FDA label,L6505] Fluconazole induced hepatotoxicity is usually reversible.[FDA label]

**Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility**

Fluconazole demonstrated no evidence of carcinogenic risk in mice and rats treated orally for 24 months at doses equivalent to approximately 2-7 time the recommended human dose). Male rats given fluconazole at doses equivalent to supratherapeutic human doses showed an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas. Cytogenetic studies in vivo and in vitro demonstrated no sign of chromosomal mutation. The significance of these findings for humans is unknown.[FDA label]

**Use in pregnancy**

There are no sufficient and well-controlled studies of fluconazole use in pregnant women. Available human data do not show an increased risk of congenital anomalies after pregnant women were treated with standard doses (<200 mg/day) of fluconazole, either in a single dose or multiple doses in the first trimester did not appear to impact the fetus negatively.[FDA label] Several case reports describe rare but striking congenital anomalies observed in infants who were exposed to fluconazole at high doses reaching 400-800 mg/day, primarily in the first trimester of pregnancy. Similar findings were observed in animal studies. If this drug is administered during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking fluconazole, the risk should be discussed thoroughly.[FDA label]

Once administered into the patient, it is extensively hydrolyzed by esterases located primarily in the liver to the active metabolite, the free carboxylate of oseltamivir [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115]. In general, the specific pharmacokinetic properties of oseltamivir, such as low protein binding and metabolism independent of the CYP450 and glucuronidase systems, suggest that a variety of clinically significant pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic interactions may be unlikely [F3097, L5161].
","Oseltamivir phosphate is a pro-drug of the active metabolite (oseltamivir carboxylate) [F3097, L5161, F3115]. The active metabolite is a potent and selective inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase enzymes, which are glycoproteins found on the virion surface [F3097, L5161, F3115]. Viral neuraminidase enzyme activity is important both for viral entry into uninfected cells and for the release of recently formed virus particles from infected cells, and for the further spread of the infectious virus in the body [F3097, L5161, F3115].

Oseltamivir carboxylate inhibits the neuraminidases of influenza viruses of both types A and B [F3097, L5161, F3115] Concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate required to inhibit the enzyme activity by 50% (IC50) are in the low nanomolar range [F3097, L5161, F3115]. Oseltamivir carboxylate also inhibits influenza virus infection and replication in-vitro and inhibits influenza virus replication and pathogenicity in-vivo [F3097, L5161, F3115].

Oseltamivir carboxylate reduces shedding of both influenza A and B virus by inhibiting the release of infectious virus from infected cells [F3097, L5161, F3115].","Oseltamivir is extensively converted to the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, by esterases located predominantly in the liver [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115]. Oseltamivir carboxylate is not further metabolized [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115]. Neither oseltamivir nor oseltamivir carboxylate is a substrate for, or inhibitor of, cytochrome P450 isoforms [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115]. No phase 2 conjugates of either compound have been identified in vivo [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115].","Oseltamivir is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration of oseltamivir phosphate (pro-drug) and is extensively converted by predominantly hepatic esterases to the active metabolite (oseltamivir carboxylate) [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115]. At least 75 % of an oral dose reaches the systemic circulation as the active metabolite [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115]. Exposure to the pro-drug is less than 5 % relative to the active metabolite [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115]. Plasma concentrations of both pro-drug and active metabolite are proportional to dose and are unaffected by co-administration with food [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115].","Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir declined with a half-life of 1 to 3 hours in most subjects after oral administration, although plasma concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate declined with a half-life of 6 to 10 hours in most subjects after oral administration [F3094, F3097].","The binding of the active oseltamivir carboxylate metabolite to human plasma protein is negligible at approximately 3 % [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115]. The binding of oseltamivir to human plasma protein is 42%, which is insufficient to cause significant displacement-based drug interactions [F3094].","Absorbed oseltamivir is primarily (> 90 %) eliminated by conversion to oseltamivir carboxylate [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115]. It is not further metabolized and is eliminated in the urine [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115]. The active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate is eliminated entirely by renal excretion [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115]. As renal clearance (18.8 l/h) exceeds glomerular filtration rate (7.5 l/h) indicating that tubular secretion occurs in addition to glomerular filtration [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115]. Less than 20 % of an oral radiolabelled dose is eliminated in faeces [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115].","The mean volume of distribution at steady state of the oseltamivir carboxylate ranges approximately between 23 and 26 liters in humans, a volume that is roughly equivalent to extracellular body fluid [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115]. Since neuraminidase activity is extracellular, oseltamivir carboxylate distributes to all sites of influenza virus spread [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115].","As the renal clearance (18.8 L/h) of oseltamivir exceeds glomerular filtration rate (7.5 L/h) indicating that tubular secretion occurs, in addition to glomerular filtration [F3097, L5161].","AgucortTamifluTamiflu-Free",0,NA,NA,1,796,"Reports of overdoses with oseltamivir have been received from clinical trials and during postmarketing experience [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115]. In the majority of cases reporting overdose, no adverse reactions were reported [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115]. Adverse reactions reported following overdose were similar in nature to those observed with therapeutic doses of oseltamivir [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115].

Although influenza is associated with adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes, with a risk of major congenital malformations, including congenital heart defects, the use of oseltamivir may be considered during pregnancy if necessary and after considering the available safety and benefit information and the pathogenicity of the circulating influenza virus strain [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115].

Based on limited published data, oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate are present in human milk at low levels considered unlikely to lead to toxicity in the breastfed infant [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115]. Exercise caution when oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension is administered to a nursing woman [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115].

Based on preclinical data, there is no evidence that oseltamivir has an effect on male or female fertility [F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115].

","In order to replicate, bacteria require a specific process of protein synthesis, enabled by ribosomal proteins [A6505]. Erythromycin acts by inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to the 23S ribosomal RNA molecule in the 50S subunit of ribosomes in susceptible bacterial organisms.  It stops bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting the transpeptidation/translocation step of protein synthesis and by inhibiting the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit [FDA label], [A14179]. This results in the control of various bacterial infections [A174193], [FDA label].   The strong affinity of macrolides, including erythromycin, for bacterial ribosomes, supports their broad-spectrum antibacterial activities [A174193]. 

Many strains of Haemophilus influenzae are resistant to erythromycin alone but are found to be susceptible to erythromycin and sulfonamides used in combination. It is important to note that _staphylocci_ resistant to erythromycin may emerge during a course of erythromycin and/or sulfonamides [FDA label].","Hepatic first-pass metabolism contributes significantly to the total metabolism of erythromycin after oral dosing [A174457]. After oral administration, less than 5% of the administered dose can be recovered in the active form in the urine and a substantial amount is found in the feces [F3322]. Erythromycin is partially metabolized by CYP3A enzymes, which results in numerous drug interactions [FDA label]. 

Erythromycin is hydrolyzed to _anhydro_ forms (anhydroerythromycin [AHE] and other metabolites), and this process is promoted by acidic conditions. AHE is microbiologically inactive but inhibits drug oxidation by the liver and is therefore considered to be an important factor in erythromycin drug-drug interactions. Acidic conditions in stomach increase the level of AHE, but high levels of AHE were also measured in inflamed tonsils [A174448].","Orally administered erythromycin stearate is readily and reliably absorbed. Optimal serum levels of erythromycin are reached when it is taken in the fasting state or immediately before meals [F3322].

Only low concentrations are usually reached in the spinal fluid, however the passage of erythromycin throughthe blood-brain barrier increases in meningitis, likely due to the presence of inflamed tissues [F3322].","CL (l/h/kg) in healthy subjects: 0.53 ± 0.13 after a 125mg intravenous dose [A174457] .","IlosoneCipa",23,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00199.pdf?1265922812","//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00199.pdf?1549317264",3,1076,"Oral LD50, rat: 9272 mg/kg [MSDS].

**Overdose**:

Symptoms of overdose may include diarrhea, nausea, stomach cramps, and vomiting. In case of overdosage, erythromycin should immediately be discontinued. Prompt elimination of unabsorbed erythromycin should be attempted, and all other appropriate supportive measures should be initiated.
Erythromycin is not removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis [FDA label].


**Hepatotoxicity**:

Erythromycin can cause hepatic dysfunction, cholestatic jaundice, and abnormal liver transaminases, particularly when _erythromycin estolate_ is administered [F3343].

**A note on pseudomembranous colitis**: 

Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with most antibacterial agents, including erythromycin, and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening.

**Pregnancy**: 

This drug is classified as pregnancy category B: There is no evidence of teratogenicity or any other adverse effect on reproduction in female rats fed erythromycin base (up to 0.25% of diet) before and during mating, during gestation, and through weaning of two successive litters. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always representative of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if it absolutely necessary [FDA label]. It is important to note that _erythromycin estolate_ is contraindicated in pregnancy [F3343].

**Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility**: 

Long-term oral studies in rats with erythromycin ethylsuccinate and erythromycin base did not show evidence of tumorigenicity. Mutagenicity studies have not been conducted to this date.

Also for the treatment of known or suspected cyanide poisoning.","Hydroxocobalamin is a synthetic, injectable form of Vitamin B12. Hydroxocobalamin is actually a precursor of two cofactors or vitamins (Vitamin B12 and Methylcobalamin) which are involved in various biological systems in man. Vitamin B12 is required for the conversion of methylmalonate to succinate. Deficiency of this enzyme could therefore interfere with the production of lipoprotein in myelin sheath tissue and so give rise to neurological lesions. The second cofactor, Methylcobalamin, is necessary for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine which is essential for the metabolism of folic acid. Deficiency of tetrahydrafolate leads to reduced synthesis of thymidylate resulting in reduced synthesis of DNA which is essential for cell maturation. Vitamin B12 is also concerned in the maintenance of sulphydryl groups in reduced form, deficiency leading to decreased amounts of reduced SH content of erythrocytes and liver cells. Overall, vitamin B12 acts as a coenzyme for various metabolic functions, including fat and carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis. It is necessary for growth, cell replication, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein as well as myelin synthesis. This is largely due to its effects on metabolism of methionine folic acid, and malonic acid.","Vitamin B12 exists in four major forms referred to collectively as cobalamins; deoxyadenosylcobalamin, methylcobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, and cyanocobalamin. Two of these, methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin, are primarily used by the body. Methionine synthase needs methylcobalamin as a cofactor. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of the amino acid homocysteine into methionine. Methionine in turn is required for DNA methylation. 5-Deoxyadenosyl cobalamin is a cofactor needed by the enzyme that converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. This conversion is an important step in the extraction of energy from proteins and fats. Furthermore, succinyl CoA is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, the substances that carries oxygen in red blood cells.","Primarily hepatic.

It is now thought that xanthines such as caffeine act as antagonists at adenosine-receptors within the plasma membrane of virtually every cell. As adenosine acts as an autocoid, inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic sites but augmenting the actions of norepinephrine or angiotensin, antagonism of adenosine receptors promotes neurotransmitter release.

The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally.

Studies establishing effectiveness were short-term (12 to 16 weeks), and included predominately patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II-III symptoms and idiopathic etiology (71%) or associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) (25%) [F3850];

b) the Canadian product monograph specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PPH) or pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disease (CTD) in adult patients with WHO functional class II or III who have not responded to conventional therapy [F3859]. In addition, improvement in exercise ability and delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated in adult patients who were already stabilized on background epoprostenol therapy [F3859]; and

c) the EMA product information specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity [F3883]. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease [F3883]. The EMA label also indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension [F3883]. Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary hemodynamics has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease [F3883].","In vitro studies have shown that sildenafil is selective for phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. In particular, there is a 10-times selectivity over PDE6 which is involved in the phototransduction pathway in the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. There is an 80-times selectivity over PDE1, and over 700-times over PDE 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. And finally, sildenafil has greater than 4,000-times selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3, the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform involved in the control of cardiac contractility [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

In eight double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies of patients with either organic or psychogenic erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation resulted in improved erections, as assessed by an objective measurement of hardness and duration of erections (via the use of RigiScan®), after sildenafil administration compared with placebo [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Most studies assessed the efficacy of sildenafil approximately 60 minutes post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The erectile response, as assessed by RigiScan®, generally increased with increasing sildenafil dose and plasma concentration [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The time course of effect was examined in one study, showing an effect for up to 4 hours but the response was diminished compared to 2 hours [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Sildenafil causes mild and transient decreases in systemic blood pressure which, in the majority of cases, do not translate into clinical effects [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with systemic hypertension the mean change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was a decrease of 9.4 mmHg and 9.1 mmHg respectively [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension lesser effects in blood pressure reduction were observed (a reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressure of 2 mmHg)[F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614] . At the recommended dose of 20 mg three times a day no reductions in systolic or diastolic pressure were seen [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Single oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg in healthy volunteers produced no clinically relevant effects on ECG [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension no clinically relevant effects on the ECG were reported either [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

In a study of the hemodynamic effects of a single oral 100 mg dose of sildenafil in 14 patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (> 70 % stenosis of at least one coronary artery), the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7 % and 6 % respectively compared to baseline [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Mean pulmonary systolic blood pressure decreased by 9% [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil showed no effect on cardiac output and did not impair blood flow through the stenosed coronary arteries [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Mild and transient differences in color discrimination (blue/green) were detected in some subjects using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test at 1 hour following a 100 mg dose, with no effects evident after 2 hours post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The postulated mechanism for this change in color discrimination is related to inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in the phototransduction cascade of the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil has no effect on visual acuity or contrast sensitivity. In a small size placebo-controlled study of patients with documented early age-related macular degeneration (n = 9), sildenafil (single dose, 100 mg) demonstrated no significant changes in visual tests conducted (which included visual acuity, Amsler grid, color discrimination simulated traffic light, and the Humphrey perimeter and photostress test) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].","Sildenafil is an oral therapy for erectile dysfunction [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. In the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation, it restores impaired erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].

The physiological mechanism responsible for the erection of the penis involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Nitric oxide then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].

Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum, where PDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has a peripheral site of action on erections [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum but potently enhances the relaxant effect of NO on this tissue [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. When the NO/cGMP pathway is activated, as occurs with sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum levels of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Therefore sexual stimulation is required in order for sildenafil to produce its intended beneficial pharmacological effects [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].

Moreover, apart from the presence of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum of the penis, PDE5 is also present in the pulmonary vasculature [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. Sildenafil, therefore, increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in relaxation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, this can lead to vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilatation in the systemic circulation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614].","The metabolism of sildenafil is facilitated primarily by the CYP3A4 hepatic microsomal isoenzymes and to a minor extent, via the CYP2C9 hepatic isoenzymes [A175654, F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The predominant circulating metabolite results from the N-demethylation of sildenafil [A175654, F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. This particular resultant metabolite possesses a phosphodiesterase selectivity that is similar to the parent sildenafil molecule and a corresponding in vitro potency for PDE5 that is approximately 50% that of the parent drug [A175654, F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Moreover, plasma concentrations of the metabolite are about 40% of those recorded for sildenafil, a percentage that accounts for about 20% of sildenafil’s pharmacologic effects [A175654, F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. This primary N-desmethyl metabolite of sildenafil also undergoes further metabolism, with a terminal half-life of about 4 hours [A175654, F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, plasma concentrations of the primary N-desmethyl metabolite are about 72% those of the original parent sildenafil molecule after a regimen of 20 mg three times a day - which is consequently responsible for about a 36% contribution to sildenafil’s overall pharmacological effects [A175654, F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].","Sildenafil is known to be quickly absorbed, with maximum plasma concentrations being observed within 30-120 minutes (with a median of 60 minutes) of oral administration in a fasting patient [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Moreover, the mean absolute bioavailability observed for sildenafil is about 41% (from a range of 25-63%) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. In particular, after oral three times a day dosing of sildenafil, the AUC and Cmax increase in proportion with dose over the recommended dosage range of 25-100 mg [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

When used in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients, however, the oral bioavailability of sildenafil after a dosing regimen of 80 mg three times a day, was on average 43% greater than compared to the lower doses [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Finally, if sildenafil is administered orally with food, the rate of absorption is observed to be decreased with a mean delay in Tmax of about 60 minutes and a mean decrease in Cmax of approximately 29% [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Regardless, the extent of absorption is not observed to be significantly affected as the recorded AUC decreased by only about 11 % [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].","The terminal phase half-life observed for sildenafil is approximately 3 to 5 hours [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].","It is generally observed that sildenafil and its main circulating N-desmethyl metabolite are both estimated to be about 96% bound to plasma proteins [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Nevertheless, it has been determined that protein binding for sildenafil is independent of total drug concentrations [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].","After either oral or intravenous administration, sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of the administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].","The mean steady-state volume of distribution documented for sildenafil is approximately 105 L - a value which suggests the medication undergoes distribution into the tissues [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].","The total body clearance documented for sildenafil is 41 L/h [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].",NA,5,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00203.pdf?1265922808","//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00203.pdf?1265922745",0,1309,"In single-dose volunteer studies of doses up to 800 mg, adverse reactions were similar to those seen at lower doses, but the incidence rates and severities were increased [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Doses of 200 mg did not result in increased efficacy but the incidence of adverse reaction (headache, flushing, dizziness, dyspepsia, nasal congestion, altered vision) was increased [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Due to the lack of data on the effect of sildenafil indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in pregnant women, sildenafil is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless also using appropriate contraceptive measures [F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614].
 
The safety and efficacy of sildenafil indicated for treating PAH in a woman during labor and delivery have not been studied [F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. Caution should ultimately be exercised when sildenafil is administered to nursing women as it is not known if sildenafil or its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk [F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614].

The safety and efficacy of sildenafil for the treatment of PAH in children below 1 year of age has not been established as no data is available [F3883].

Clinical experience with the elderly population in the use of sildenafil for the treatment of PAH has been varied. Some reports suggest that there are no identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients [F3850] while others have documented that clinical efficacy as measured by 6-minute walk distance could be less in elderly patients [L5614]. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [F3850].

Conversely, when sildenafil was used to treat erectile dysfunction in healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over), a reduced clearance of sildenafil was observed [F3853, L5611]. This reduction resulted in about 90% higher plasma concentrations of sildenafil and the active N-desmethyl metabolite compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers (18-45 years) [F3853, L5611]. Due to age-differences in plasma protein binding, the corresponding increase in free sildenafil plasma concentration was approximately 40% [F3853, L5611].

Sildenafil was not carcinogenic when administered to rats for 24 months at a dose resulting in total systemic drug exposure (AUCs) for unbound sildenafil and its major metabolite of 29- and 42- times, for male and female rats, respectively, the exposures observed in human males given the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 100 mg [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil was not carcinogenic when administered to mice for 18-21 months at dosages up to the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of 10 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.6 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Sildenafil was negative in in vitro bacterial and Chinese hamster ovary cell assays to detect mutagenicity, and in vitro human lymphocytes and in vivo mouse micronucleus assays to detect clastogenicity [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

There was no impairment of fertility in rats given sildenafil up to 60 mg/kg/day for 36 days to females and 102 days to males, a dose producing an AUC value of more than 25 times the human male AUC [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]."

Azithromycin has additional immunomodulatory effects and has been used in chronic respiratory inflammatory diseases for this purpose [A174172].

","In order to replicate, bacteria require a specific process of protein synthesis, enabled by ribosomal proteins [A6505]. Azithromycin binds to the 23S rRNA of the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit. It stops bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting the transpeptidation/translocation step of protein synthesis and by inhibiting the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit [FDA label], [A14179]. This results in the control of various bacterial infections [A174193], [FDA label].   The strong affinity of macrolides, including azithromycin, for bacterial ribosomes, is consistent with their broad-spectrum antibacterial activities [A174193].


Azithromycin is highly stable at a low pH, giving it a longer serum half-life and increasing its concentrations in tissues compared to erythromycin [A174175]. 

","In vitro and in vivo studies to assess the metabolism of azithromycin have not been performed [FDA label], however, this drug is eliminated by the liver [A174202], [FDA label].","Bioavailability of azithromycin is 37% following oral administration. Absorption is not affected by food.  Macrolide absorption in the intestines is believed to be mediated by P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) efflux transporters, which are known to be encoded by the _ABCB1_ gene [A174175].","Terminal elimination half-life: 68 hours [FDA label]","The serum protein binding of azithromycin varies in humans, decreasing from 51% at 0.02 g/mL to 7% at 2 g/mL [FDA label].","Biliary excretion of azithromycin, primarily as unchanged drug, is a major route of elimination.

**A note on potential renal toxicity**:

Because limited data in patients with renal GFR <10 mL/min, caution should be exercised when prescribing azithromycin to these patients [FDA label].

**Use in Pregnancy**:

This drug is categorized as a pregnancy category B drug. Reproduction studies have been done in rats and mice at doses up to moderately maternally toxic doses (for example, 200 mg/kg/day). These doses, based on a mg/m2 basis, are approximately 4 and 2 times, respectively, the human daily dose of 500 mg. In the animal studies, no harmful effects to the fetus due to azithromycin were observed. There are, at this time, no conclusive and well-controlled studies that have been done in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies do not always predict human response, azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed [FDA label].

**Nursing Mothers**: 

It is unknown at this time whether azithromycin is excreted in human milk. Because many other drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be observed when azithromycin is given to a nursing woman [FDA label].

**Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility**:

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [DB01060], [DB01211], and [DB00916], for example [A177271][F4498]. Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00736], [DB00448], [DB05351], and [DB01129].

Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole's duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours [FDA Label].

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life [A177571].

PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580].

**General Effects**

Pantoprazole has been shown to reduce acid reflux-related symptoms, heal inflammation of the esophagus, and improve patient quality of life more effectively than histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers). This drug has an excellent safety profile and a low incidence of drug interactions. It can be used safely in various high-risk patient populations, including the elderly and those with renal failure or moderate hepatic dysfunction [A174226].  

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life [A177571].

PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580]. 

**A note on laboratory testing abnormalities**

During treatment with antisecretory medicinal products such as pantoprazole, serum gastrin (a peptide hormone that stimulates secretion of gastric acid) increases in response to the decreased acid secretion caused by proton pump inhibition. The increased gastrin level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Published evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors should be stopped 14 days before chromogranin A (CgA) measurements. This permits chromogranin A levels, that might be falsely elevated after proton pump inhibitor treatment, to return to the normal reference range [F3217]. 

Reports have been made of false-positive results in urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving the majority of proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole. A confirmatory method should be used [F3217].","Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump, expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach [A174295]. ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid). 

Proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole are substituted _benzimidazole_ derivatives, weak bases, which accumulate in the acidic space of the parietal cell before being converted in the _canaliculi_  (small canal) of the gastric parietal cell, an acidic environment, to active _sulfenamide_ derivatives. This active form then makes disulfide bonds with important cysteines on the gastric acid pump, inhibiting its function [A174247]. Specifically, pantoprazole binds to the _sulfhydryl group_ of H+, K+-ATPase, which is an enzyme implicated in accelerating the final step in the acid secretion pathway. The enzyme is inactivated, inhibiting gastric acid secretion [A174253]. The inhibition of gastric acid secretion is stronger with proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole and lasts longer than with the H(2) antagonists [A174295].","Pantoprazole is heavily metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Pantoprazole metabolism is independent of the route of administration (intravenous or oral). The main metabolic pathway is _demethylation_, by _CYP2C19_ hepatic cytochrome enzyme, followed by sulfation; other metabolic pathways include oxidation by CYP3A4. There is no evidence that any of the pantoprazole metabolites are pharmacologically active [F3202].

After hepatic metabolism, almost 80% of an oral or intravenous dose is excreted as metabolites in urine; the remainder is found in feces and originates from biliary secretion [A174256].","Pantoprazole is absorbed after oral administration as an enteric-coated tablet with maximum plasma concentrations attained within 2 – 3 hours and a bioavailability of 77% that does not change with multiple dosing [A174247]. Following an oral dose of 40mg, the Cmax is approximately 2.5 µg/mL with a tmax of 2 to 3 hours. The AUC is approximately 5 µg.h/mL. There is no food effect on AUC (bioavailability) and Cmax[F4486].

Delayed-release tablets are prepared as enteric-coated tablets so that absorption of pantoprazole begins only after the tablet leaves the stomach.","About 1 hour [F3202].","Approximately 98% [FDA label].","After a single oral or intravenous (IV) dose of 14C-labeled pantoprazole to healthy, normal metabolizing subjects, about 71% of the dose was excreted in the urine, with 18% excreted in the feces by biliary excretion. There was no kidney excretion of unchanged pantoprazole [F3202].","The apparent volume of distribution of pantoprazole is approximately 11.0-23.6 L, distributing mainly in the extracellular fluid [FDA label].","**Adults**: With intravenous administration of pantoprazole to extensive metabolizers, total clearance is 7.6-14.0 L/h [F3193].
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the total clearance increased with increasing body weight in a non-linear fashion [F3193].

**Tumorigenicity**

Because of the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for long-term administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and its administration lead to rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown at this time [F3202].

**Teratogenic Effects**

This drug falls under pregnancy category B category. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 88 times the recommended human dose (RHD), as well as in rabbits at oral doses up to 16 times the RHD, and have shown no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus caused by pantoprazole. No adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have been completed. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should only be used during pregnancy if clearly required [F3202].

**Nursing Mothers**

Pantoprazole and its metabolites have been found to be excreted in the milk of rats. Pantoprazole excretion in human milk has been found in a study performed with a single nursing mother after one 40 mg oral dose. The clinical relevance of this finding is not known, however, it is advisable to take note of this finding when considering pantoprazole use during nursing.

From this condition, it has been observed that torasemide is very effective in cases of kidney failure.[FDA label]

Edema is considered when swelling is observed due to the trap of fluid in the body tissue. It is mainly located in feet, ankles and legs but it can also be extended to other parts such as face, hands and abdomen or even the whole body.[L5251]

As well, torasemide is approved to be used as an antihypertensive agent either alone or in combination with other antihypertensives.[FDA label]

Hypertension is defined by the presence of high blood pressure. This is caused by an increase in the amount of blood pumped which in order produces the narrowing of the arteries.[L5254]","It is widely known that administration of torasemide can attenuate renal injury and reduce the severity of acute renal failure. This effect is obtained by increasing urine output and hence, facilitating fluid, acid-base and potassium control.[A174466] This effect is obtained by the increase in the excretion of urinary sodium and chloride.[A174472]

Several reports have indicated that torasemide presents a long-lasting diuresis and less potassium excretion which can be explained by the effect that torasemide has on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This effect is very similar to the effect observed with the administration of combination therapy with [furosemide] and [spironolactone] and it is characterized by a decrease in plasma brain natriuretic peptide and improved measurements of left ventricular function.[A174472] 

Above the aforementioned effect, torasemide presents a dual effect .in which the inhibition of aldosterone which donates torasemide with a potassium-sparing action.[A174466]

Torasemide has been shown to reduce extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure in hypertensive patients suffering from chronic kidney disease. As well, some reports have indicated that torasemide can reduce myocardial fibrosis by reducing the collagen accumulation. This effect is suggested to be related to the decrease in aldosterone which in order has been shown to reduce the production of the enzyme procollagen type I carboxy-terminal proteinase which is known to be overexpressed in heart failure patients.[A174463]","As mentioned above, torasemide is part of the loop diuretics and thus, it acts by reducing the oxygen demand in the medullary thick ascending loop of Henle by inhibiting the Na+/K+/Cl- pump on the luminal cell membrane surface.[A174466] This action is obtained by the binding of torasemide to a chloride ion-binding site of the transport molecule.[L5257]

Torasemide is known to have an effect in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by inhibiting the downstream cascade after the activation of angiotensin II. This inhibition will produce a secondary effect marked by the reduction of the expression of aldosterone synthase, TGF-B1 and thromboxane A2 and a reduction on the aldosterone receptor binding.[A174466, A174472]","Torasemide is extensively metabolized in the liver and only 20% of the dose remains unchanged and it is recovered in the urine.[A174475] Metabolized via the hepatic CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 mainly by reactions of hydroxylation, oxidation and reduction to 5 metabolites.[A174514] The major metabolite, M5, is pharmacologically inactive. There are 2 minor metabolites, M1, possessing one-tenth the activity of torasemide, and M3, equal in activity to torasemide.

It has been found to relieve or manage symptoms of depression, anxiety, eating disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder among other mood disorders. The antidepressant, anti-anxiety, and other actions of citalopram are linked to its inhibition of CNS central uptake of serotonin [FDA label]. Serotonergic abnormalities have been reported in patients with mood disorders. Behavioral and neuropsychological of effects of serotonin include the regulation of mood, perception, reward, anger, aggression, appetite, memory, sexuality, and attention, as examples. The onset of action for depression is approximately 1 to 4 weeks. The complete response may take 8-12 weeks after initiation of citalopram [L5224].

 <i>In vitro</i> studies demonstrate that citalopram is a strong and selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine central reuptake. The chronic administration of citalopram has been shown to downregulate central norepinephrine receptors, similar to other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Citalopram does not inhibit monoamine oxidase [A325].","
The mechanism of action of citalopram results from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) [FDA label].  The molecular target for citalopram is the serotonin transporter (solute carrier family 6 member 4, _SLC6A4_), inhibiting its serotonin reuptake in the synaptic cleft [A37688].

Citalopram binds with significantly less affinity to histamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine receptors than tricyclic antidepressant drugs [FDA label]. This drug has no or neglible affinity for _5-HT1A_, _5-HT2A_, _dopamine D_1 and _D2_, _a1-_, _a2_-, and_ ß­ adrenergic_, _histamine H1_, _gamma-aminobutyric acid_ (GABA), _muscarinic_,  _cholinergic_, and _benzodiazepine_ receptors. Antagonism of _muscarinic_, _histaminergic_, and _adrenergic receptors_ is thought to be associated with several anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects of other psychotropic drugs [FDA label].","Citalopram is metabolized mainly in the liver via <i>N</i>-demethylation to its main metabolite, _demethylcitalopram_ by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 [A174382]. Other metabolites include _didemethylcitalopram_ via CYP2D6 metabolism, and _citalopram <i>N</i>-oxide_ via monoamine oxidase enzymes and aldehyde oxidase. It is a deaminated propionic acid derivative [A174382]. 

After a single dose of citalopram, peak blood concentrations occur at approximately 4 hours [FDA label]. This drug in is found mainly unchanged in the plasma as citalopram. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 2C19 isozymes appear to be heavily involved in producing _demethylcitalopram_. Demethylcitalopram appears to be further <i>N</i>-demethylated by CYP2D6 to didemethylcitalopram. Citalopram metabolites exert little pharmacologic activity in comparison to the parent drug and are not likely to contribute to the clinical effect of citalopram [A325].

Symptoms of toxicity include dizziness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, tremor, somnolence, and sinus tachycardia. Rarely, symptoms included amnesia, confusion, coma, convulsions, hyperventilation, cyanosis, rhabdomyolysis, and ECG changes (including QTc prolongation, nodal rhythm, ventricular arrhythmia, and extremely rare cases of cardiac torsade de pointes) may occur. Acute renal failure has been a rare occurrence [A325].

In cases of overdose, establish and maintain the airway to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygen delivery. Due to the large volume of distribution of citalopram, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. Gastric evacuation by lavage and use of activated charcoal should be considered. Careful observation and cardiac and vital sign monitoring are advised, in addition to supportive care. With the large volume of distribution of citalopram, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit [FDA label].

**Pregnancy**

This drug is categorized as pregnancy category C. In animal reproduction studies, citalopram has been shown to have adverse effects on embryo/fetal and postnatal development, which includes teratogenic effects when given at doses higher than human therapeutic doses. There are no sufficient and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore, citalopram should be used during pregnancy only in cases where the potential benefit justifies the possible risk to the fetus [FDA label].

**Pregnancy-Nonteratogenic Effects**

Neonates exposed to celexa and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester, have undergone complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and parenteral feeding. Complications such as these can arise immediately upon delivery [FDA label]. 

**Nursing Mothers**

Citalopram is excreted in human breast milk. There have been two reports of infants demonstrating high levels of somnolence, reduced feeding, and weight loss associated with breastfeeding from a mother taking citalopram. In one specific case, the infant was reported to recover completely after the discontinuation of citalopram.  In the second case, no follow-up information was available for assessment. The decision whether to continue or discontinue either nursing or celexa should consider the risks of citalopram exposure for the infant versus the benefits of celexa treatment for the mother [FDA label].

Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder with increasing prevalences worldwide; it is characterized by insulin resistance in accordance with progressive ß cell failure and long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications that lead to co-morbidities and mortalities. Sulfonylureas are one of the insulin secretagogues widely used for the management of type 2 diabetes to lower blood glucose levels. The main effect of SUs is thought to be effective when residual pancreatic ß-cells are present [A177715], as they work by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells and they are also thought to exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as increasing the insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake [A177709]. 

Glimepiride works by stimulating the secretion of insulin granules from pancreatic islet beta cells by blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K<SUB>ATP</SUB> channels) and causing depolarization of the beta cells. Compared to [glipizide], another second SU drug, glimepiride has a longer duration of action.

It may also be indicated for use in combination with metformin or insulin to lower blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes whose high blood sugar levels cannot be controlled by diet and exercise in conjunction with an oral hypoglycemic (a drug used to lower blood sugar levels) agent alone [F4540].","Glimepiride stimulates the secretion of insulin granules from the pancreatic beta cells and improves the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin to increase peripheral glucose uptake, thus reducing plasma blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels. A multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of glimepiride (1–8 mg) as monotherapy titrated over 10 weeks compared with placebo in T2DM subjects who were not controlled by diet alone [A177703]. In this study, there was a reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) by 46 mg/dL, post-prandial glucose (PPG) by 72 mg/dL, and HbA1c by 1.4% more than the placebo [A177703]. In another randomized study comprising of patients with T2DM receiving either placebo or one of the three doses (1, 4, or 8 mg) of glimepiride during a 14-week study period, all glimepiride regimens significantly reduced FPG, PPG, and HbA1c values (P < 0.001) compared to placebo by the end of the study period [A177703]. The 4- and 8-mg doses of glimepiride were more effective than the 1-mg dose; however, the 4-mg dose provided a nearly maximal antihyperglycemic effect [A177703].","ATP-sensitive potassium channels on pancreatic beta cells that are gated by intracellular ATP and ADP. The hetero-octomeric complex of the channel is composed of four pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. Alternative splicing allows the formation of channels composed of varying subunit isoforms expressed at different concentrations in different tissues [A177730]. In pancreatic beta cells, ATP-sensitive potassium channels play a role as essential metabolic sensors and regulators that couple membrane excitability with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) [A177727]. When there is a decrease in the ATP:ADP ratio, the channels are activated and open, leading to K+ efflux from the cell, membrane hyperpolarization, and suppression of insulin secretion [A177727]. In contrast, increased uptake of glucose into the cell leads to elevated intracellular ATP:ADP ratio, leading to the closure of channels and membrane depolarization. Depolarization leads to activation and opening of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and consequently an influx of calcium ions into the cell [A177727]. Elevated intracellular calcium levels causes the contraction of the filaments of actomyosin responsible for the exocytosis of insulin granules stored in vesicles [A177715]. Glimepiride blocks the ATP-sensitive potassium channel by binding non-specifically to the B sites of both sulfonylurea receptor-1 (SUR1) and sulfonylurea receptor-2A (SUR2A) subunits as well as the A site of SUR1 subunit of the channel [A177715] to promote insulin secretion from the beta cell.","Glimepiride is reported to undergo hepatic metabolism. Following either an intravenous or oral dose, glimepiride undergoes oxidative biotransformation mediated by CYP2C9 enzyme to form a major metabolite, cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl derivative (M1), that is pharmacologically active. M1 can be further metabolized to the inactive metabolite carboxyl derivative (M2) by one or several cytosolic enzymes. M1 retained approximately one third of the pharmacologic activity of its parent in an animal model, with a half-life of 3-6 hours [A177715]. However, whether the glucose-lowering effect of M1 is clinically significant is not clear.","Glimepiride is completely absorbed after oral administration within 1 hour of administration with a linear pharmacokinetics profile [A177703]. Following administration of a single oral dose of glimepiride in healthy subjects and with multiple oral doses with type 2 diabetes, the peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) were reached after 2 to 3 hours post-dose [FDA Label]. Accumulation does not occur after multiple doses [A177703]. When glimepiride was given with meals, the time to reach Cmax was increased by 12% while the mean and AUC (area under the curve) were decreased by 8 to 9%, respectively [F4540]. In a pharmacokinetic study of Japanese patients with T2DM, Cmax value in once-daily dose was higher than those in twice-daily doses [A177724]. The absolute bioavailability of glimepiride is reported to be complete following oral administration [A177721].","The elimination half-life of glimepiride is approximately 5 to 8 hours [A177715], which can increase up to 9 hours following multiple doses [A177709].","Plasma protein binding of glimepiride is greater than 99.5% [FDA Label].","Following oral administration of glimepiride in healthy male subjects, approximately 60% of the total radioactivity was recovered in the urine in 7 days, with M1 and M2 accounting for 80-90% of the total radioactivity recovered in the urine. The ratio of M1 to M2 was approximately 3:2 in two subjects and 4:1 in one subject [FDA Label]. Approximately 40% of the total radioactivity was recovered in feces where M1 and M2 accounted for about 70% of the radioactivity and a ratio of M1 to M2 being 1:3.

In these studies, the total body clearance was 52.1 +/- 16.0 mL/min, 48.5 +/- 29.3 mL/min in patients with T2D given a single oral dose, and 52.7 +/- 40.3 mL/min in patients with T2D given multiple oral doses [F4540].

Although glimepiride is reported to have fewer risks of hypoglycemia compared to other sulfonylureas such as glyburide, overdosage of glimepiride may result in severe hypoglycemia with coma, seizure, or other neurological impairment may occur. This can be treated with glucagon or intravenous glucose. Continued observation and additional carbohydrate intake may be necessary since hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery [FDA Label]. 

In a study of rats given doses of up to 5000 parts per million (ppm) in complete feed for 30 months, there were no signs of carcinogenesis. Meanwhile, the administration of glimepiride at a dose much higher than the maximum human recommended dose for 24 months in mice resulted in an increase in benign pancreatic adenoma formation in a dose-related manner, which was thought to be the result of chronic pancreatic stimulation [FDA Label]. Glimepiride was non-mutagenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. In male and female rat studies, glimepiride was shown to have no effects on fertility [FDA Label]."

Paramagnetic agents have unpaired electrons that generate a magnetic field about 700 times larger than the proton's field, thus disturbing the proton's local magnetic field. When the local magnetic field around a proton is disturbed, its relaxation process is altered. MR images are based on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. MR instruments can record 2 different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and the T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visualization of normal and pathological brain tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in the T2.

In individuals with risk factors related to elevated total cholesterol, elevated LDL cholesterol and below average HDL cholesterol, lovastatin can be used to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, unstable angina and coronary revascularization procedures.[FDA label]

As well, lovastatin is indicated to slow the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with coronary heart disease.[FDA label]

Lovastatin is used as part of the multiple risk factor intervention with a saturated fat-restricted diet in patients with significantly increased risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. The administration of lovastatin is restricted to patients to whom the administration of a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol or the application of nonpharmaceutical measures are inadequate or irresponsive.[FDA label]  

Lovastatin is indicated as an adjunct therapy to diet to reduce total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B level in adolescents between 10-17 years. The administration of lovastatin is restricted to patients in which adequate diet has been unresponsive as seen by LDL cholesterol higher than 189 mg/dL or LDL cholesterol higher than 160 mg/dL and history of family cardiovascular disease or with two or more cardiovascular disease risk factors.[FDA label]

Before administering lovastatin, it is important to rule out the presence of secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia and a lipid profile should be performed.[FDA label]

Lovastatin is used off-label for the treatment and management of peripheral artery disease.[T415]","Based on the mechanism of action of lovastatin, we can understand that the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase produces a limitation in cholesterol biosynthesis and this limitation induces an increase in the generation of microsomal HMG-CoA reductase and cell surface LDL receptors. Hence, cell cholesterol is provided by de novo synthesis and by receptor-cell uptake of LDL from the blood which resets tissue homeostasis.[A174583]

The administration of lovastatin is observed by the significant inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. The 50% inhibitory dose is known to be of 46 mcg/kg which is translated into a reduction of approximately 30% of plasma cholesterol.[A174553] This effect is obtained by the reduction of low-density lipoprotein C, reduction of circulating LDL particles, modest reductions on very low-density lipoprotein C and plasma triglycerides as well as an increase in high-density lipoprotein C.[L5284] The effect of lovastatin against LDL cholesterol is thought to be related to the normal mechanism of action as well as to an increase in LDL receptor family activity.[A174580]

In hypercholesterolemia animal models and clinical trials, lovastatin has been proven to effectively reduce the total and LDL cholesterol in serum.[A174565] In these clinical reports, lovastatin was shown to reduce by 25-40% the concentration of LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol in plasma in patients suffering from hypercholesterolemia.[A174580]","Lovastatin is a potent competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase and it presents a Ki of 1.4 nM. The inhibition of this enzyme directly interferes with the biosynthesis of mevalonic acid which is the precursor in the production pathway of terpenes and steroids.[A174553]

The effect of lovastatin is expected to be mainly directed to the liver since it is the major site of cholesterol biosynthesis, lipoprotein production and LDL catabolism, however, the synthesis of cholesterol is also necessary for extrahepatic tissues. Hence, long term treatment with lovastatin can derive in the onset of adverse reactions due to the extrahepatic action.[A174580]

Some reports have indicated a role of lovastatin in the inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. This activity seems to be related to the effect that lovastatin presents against adenyl cyclase alpha subunits as observed by a lovastatin-induced decrease on ADP-ribosylation.[A174568]","Lovastatin is given as a lactone prodrug and thus, in order to produce its mechanism of action, it is required to be converted to the active beta-hydroxy form. This drug activation process does not seem to be related to CYP isoenzyme activity[A414] but rather to be controlled by the activity of serum paraoxonase.[A15320]

Afterward, the metabolism of lovastatin is mainly performed by cytochrome CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6.[L5293] The uptake of lovastatin by the liver is enhanced by the activity of OATP1B1.[A35026] The metabolism of lovastatin produces several polar metabolites from which one fraction consists of a 2:1 mixture of 6-hydroxy-lovastatin and delta 4,5-3-hydroxy lovastatin. Additionally, it is possible to find desacyl-delta 4a,6,8-dehydro lovastatin which is a single aromatized product and 4, 8a, 1-3-hydroxy lovastatin.[A174589]","Studies suggest that less than 5% of the oral dose reaches the general circulation as active inhibitors and the time to peak serum concentration is 2-4 hours. Lovastatin undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism so the availability of the drug in the system is low and variable.[L5284]

The peak concentrations of lovastatin when a dose of 10-40 mg is administered are reported to range from 1.04-4.03 ng/ml and an AUC of 14-53 ng.h/ml.

Since voltage gated calcium channels are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system, pregabalin is able to modulate the release of several excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, substance-P, norepinephrine and calcitonin gene related peptide. This results in inhibition of overexcited neurons, which ultimately returns them to a normal state of function [A31163].  As a result, Pregabalin has anticonvulsant, analgesic, anxiolytic and sleep modulating effects. [A173995]","Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, studies involving structurally related drugs suggest that the presynaptic binding of pregabalin to voltage-gated calcium channels is key to the antiseizure and antinociceptive effects observed in animal models [FDA label].  By binding presynaptically to the alpha2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system, pregabalin modulates the release of several excitatory neurotransmitters [A31163].  In addition, pregabalin prevents the alpha2-delta subunit from being trafficked from the dorsal root ganglia to the spinal dorsal horn which contributes to the blunting of excitatory neurotransmitter release [A36628].  Interestingly, although pregabalin is a structural derivative of inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it does not bind directly to GABA or benzodiazepine receptors [A31165].","In humans, less than 2% of pregabalin is metabolized and it is excreted virtually unchanged in the urine [A31165].","Absorption of pregabalin is rapid and extensive reflecting it's relatively quick onset of efficacy.  Maximal plasma concentration occurs ~1 hour after administration and steady state occurs within 24-48 hours.

"DB00231","APRD00676","small molecule",2005-06-13,2019-07-02,"Temazepam","Temazepam, like many other similar and related benzodiazepines, acts as a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulator and is capable of eliciting a variety of actions including sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721].

Although the chemical synthesis of temazepam was established by 1965 [A175333], mainstream contemporary use of the medication did not occur until it's legitimate use as treatment for insomnia was accepted and approved later on. In particular, before temazepam saw regular prescription use in civilians it was - and still is - employed by the US military as a sedative-hypnotic medication to be taken by soldiers, pilots, etc. to obtain the necessary rest required for medical recovery or scheduled maneuvers and operations [A175339]. Regardless, temazepam has become one of the most frequently prescribed medications internationally and sees millions of prescriptions every year. Unfortunately, however, given its frequent use and the inherent nature of its pharmacological effects, temazepam - like many other benzodiazepines - possesses a high potential for misuse and is genuinely capable of developing drug tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction in users.","846-50-4","CHB1QD2QSS",300.74,300.066555377,"solid",2,10,0,1,NA,"Temazepam is specifically indicated only for the short-term management of insomnia [FDA Label], [L5539]. Furthermore, such management is generally predominantly associated with the symptomatic relief of transient and short-term insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings and/or early morning awakenings [F3718]. In particular, the official prescribing information for temazepam typically specifies that the instructions issued for dispensed prescriptions of the medication should indicate specifically that patients are only expected to use the therapy for short periods of time - usually 7-10 days in general [FDA Label, F3718]. Subsequently, treatment with temazepam should usually not exceed 7 to 10 consecutive days and nor should it be prescribed in quantities exceeding a one-month supply [F3718].

Some regional prescribing information also notes that temazepam may be used for premedication prior to minor surgery or other related procedures [L5539].","Temazepam is a benzodiazepine used as a hypnotic agent in the management of insomnia [FDA Label] [A175207, A175210, L5539, F3718, F3721]. Temazepam produces CNS depression at limbic, thalamic, and hypothalamic levels of the CNS [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. Temazepam increases the affinity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) for GABA receptors by binding to benzodiazepine receptors [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. Results are sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721].

In sleep laboratory studies, the effect of temazepam was compared to placebo during a two week period [F3718]. The studies demonstrated a linear dose-response improvement in total sleep time and sleep latency with substantial drug-placebo differences apparent for total sleep time and for sleep latency at higher doses of temazepam [F3718]. Regardless, REM sleep was ultimately unchanged but slow wave sleep was decreased [F3718].

Moreover, a transient syndrome, known as ""rebound insomnia"", wherein the symptoms that led to treatment with temazepam in the first place recur in an enhanced form, may happen on withdrawal of temazepam treatment [F3718]. The possibility of this occurrence is in part why long term use of temazepam is not recommended due to worries over tolerance and dependence wherein patients' bodies become physiologically accustomed to the regular presence and pharmacological effect of higher and higher doses of the benzodiazepine used [F3718].

The duration of hypnotic effect and the profile of unwanted adverse effects may be influenced by the distribution and elimination half-lives of the administered temazepam and any active metabolites that may be formed [F3718]. When such half-lives are long, the drug or its metabolite(s) may accumulate during periods of nightly administration and be associated with impairments of cognitive and motor performance during waking hours [F3718]. Conversely, if half-lives are short, the drug and metabolites would be cleared before the next dose is ingested, and carry-over effects related to sedation or CNS depression should be minimal or not present at all [F3718]. However, during nightly use and for an extended period, pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some effects of benzodiazepine hypnotics may develop - which may also contribute to the possibility of 'rebound insomnia' [F3718].

Consequently, if the drug has a very short elimination half-life, it is possible that a relative deficiency (for example, in relation to benzodiazepine GABA(a) receptor sites) may occur at some point in the interval between each night's use [F3718]. This sequence of events may account for certain clinical findings reported happening after several weeks of nightly use of rapidly eliminated benzodiazepine hypnotics, including increased wakefulness during the last third of the night and the appearance of increased daytime anxiety [F3718].","Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is considered the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human body [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. When GABA binds to GABA(a) receptors found in neuron synapses, chloride ions are conducted across neuron cell membranes via an ion channel in the receptors [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. With enough chloride ions conducted, the local, associated neuron membrane potentials are hyperpolarized - making it more difficult or less likely for action potentials to fire, ultimately resulting in less excitation of the neurons [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. 

Subsequently, benzodiazepines like temazepam can bind to benzodiazepine receptors that are components of various varieties of GABA(a) receptors [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. This binding acts to enhance the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA(a) receptor, which ultimately enhances GABA ligand binding at the receptors [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. This enhanced ligand binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the receptors increases the aforementioned chloride ion conduction (perhaps reportedly via an increase in the frequency of the chloride channel opening), resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the associated neuron cells [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. Combined with the notion that such benzodiazepine receptor associated GABA(a) receptors exist both peripherally and in the CNS, this activity consequently facilitates various effects like sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721].","First-pass metabolism of temazepam is minimal at approximately 5-8% of an administered dose [F3718, L5539]. Nevertheless, temazepam is principally metabolized in the liver where most of the unchanged drug is directly conjugated to glucuronide and excreted in the urine [F3718, L5539]. In particular, the primary metabolite present in the blood is the O-conjugate of temazepam [FDA Label, F3718, L5539]. Less than 5% of the drug is demethylated to oxazepam and subsequently eliminated as the glucuronide [F3718, L5539]. Regardless, the glucuronides of temazepam have no demonstrable CNS activity and it is believed that no active metabolites are formed in general [FDA Label, F3718, L5539].","Studies demonstrate that between 90 to 100% of an orally administered temazepam dose is absorbed, making the medication very well absorbed [F3718, L5539]. The oral administration of 15 to 45 mg temazepam resulted in rapid absorption with significant blood levels achieved in 30 minutes and peak levels at 2-3 hours [F3718, L5539]. In particular, direct studies following the oral ingestion of 30 mg of temazepam revealed measurable plasma concentrations were obtained 10-20 minutes after dosing with peak plasma levels ranging between 666-982 ng/mL (with a mean of 865 ng/mL) presenting approximately 1.2-1.6 hours (with a mean of 1.5 hours) after the dosing [FDA Label]. Finally, a dose-proportional relationship was established for the area under the plasma concentration/time curve over the 15 to 30 mg dose range [FDA Label].","The terminal half-life determined for temazepam is recorded as being between 3.5-18 hours, with a mean of 9 hours [F3718, L5539].","It has been recorded that about 96% of unchanged temazepam is bound to plasma proteins [F3718, L5539].
","Following a single dose, 80-90% of the dose appears in the urine, predominantly as the O-conjugate metabolite, and 3-13% of the dose appears in the faeces [FDA Label] [F3718, L5539]. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted unchanged or as N-desmethyltemazepam in the urine [FDA Label] [F3718, L5539].","The volume of distribution documented for temazepam is 1.3-1.5 L/kg body weight - and in particular, 43-68 L/kg for the unbound fraction [L5539].","Studies regarding the clearance of temazepam have recorded the values of 1.03 ml/min/kg and 31 ml/min/kg for the clearance of total temazepam and the clearance of unbound temazepam, respectively [A175306].","EuhypnosNorkotralNormisonNortemRemestanTemazeTemtabs",0,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00231.pdf?1551223963","//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00231.pdf?1551224326",3,1812,"Manifestations of acute overdosage of temazepam, as with other benzodiazepines, can be expected to reflect the increasing CNS effects of the drug and include somnolence, confusion, and coma, with reduced or absent reflexes [FDA Label] [L5539, F3718, F3721]. With large overdoses, respiratory depression, hypotension, and finally coma can occur [FDA Label] [L5539, F3718, F3721].

Benzodiazepines like temazepam might cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Transplacental distribution has in the past resulted in neonatal CNS depression following the ingestion of therapeutic doses of related benzodiazepine hypnotics like diazepam during the last weeks of pregnancy [FDA Label] [L5539, F3718, F3721].

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk [FDA Label] [L5539, F3718, F3721]. Caution should, therefore, be exercised when temazepam is administered to a nursing woman [FDA Label] [L5539, F3718, F3721].

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established [FDA Label] [L5539, F3718, F3721].

Lower doses of temazepam, like 7.5 mg is recommended as the initial dosage for patients aged 65 and over since the risk of the development of oversedation, dizziness, confusion, ataxia and/or falls increases substantially with larger doses of benzodiazepines in elderly and debilitated patients [FDA Label] [L5539, F3718, F3721].

No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed in animal studies although hyperplastic liver nodules were observed in female mice exposed to the highest doses of temazepam [FDA Label] [L5539, F3718, F3721]. The clinical significance of this finding is not known [FDA Label] [L5539, F3718, F3721].

"DB00241","APRD00266","small molecule",2005-06-13,2019-06-04,"Butalbital","Butalbital, or 5-allyl-5-isobutylbarbituric acid, is a derivative of barbituric acid which the hydrogens at position 5 are substituted by an allyl group and an isobutyl group. It is a short-to-intermediate acting member of barbiturates that exhibit muscle-relaxing and anti-anxiety properties that produce central nervous system (CNS) depression that ranges from mild sedation to general anesthesia [A177754]. Butalbital has a low degree of selectivity and a narrow therapeutic index [A177754]. Typically indicated to manage tension (or muscle contraction) headaches, butalbital is often combined with one or more therapeutic agents, such as acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine. There have not been clinical trials that evaluate the clinical efficacy of butalbital in migraines [A177754] thus it is not indicated for such condition. As with other barbiturates, butalbital carries a risk of abuse or misuse potential, intoxication, hangover, tolerance, dependence, and overdosage possibly leading to death [FDA Label]. Butalbital-containing analgesics can also produce a drug-induced headache in addition to tolerance and dependence. Due to these risks, the use of butalbital-containing combination products is typically limited for use only in cases where other medications are deemed ineffective and such usage is advised to be carefully monitored [A177754].","77-26-9","KHS0AZ4JVK",224.2563,224.116092388,"solid",2,7,1,1,NA,"Indicated for the management of the symptom complex of tension (or muscle contraction) headache, when other non-opioid analgesics and alternative treatments are inadequate, in various combinations with acetaminophen, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine [FDA Label].","Butalbital is a short to intermediate-acting barbiturate that reversibly depresses the activity of excitable tissues, including the central nervous system in a nonselective manner [A177754]. Barbiturates exhibit muscle-relaxing and anti-anxiety properties [A177763] and they are capable of producing all levels of CNS mood alteration from excitation to mild sedation, hypnosis, and deep coma [F4561]. The sedative dose of butalbital in nontolerant individuals is 5-100 mg and the hypnotic dose is 100-200 mg [T598]. Pain perception and reaction are relatively unimpaired until the moment of unconsciousness [A177754]. In some cases, an unwanted paradoxical response of excitement may be observed instead of sedation with barbiturate treatment, which may be due to their depressant effects on inhibitory centers of the CNS [A177754]. At sufficiently high therapeutic doses, barbiturates induce anesthesia; however, barbiturates are reported to lose their effectiveness for sleep induction and sleep maintenance after 2 weeks [F4561]. Barbiturates are habit-forming; they can produce tolerance and both dependence and addiction, which is partly explained by decreased drug concentration at the site of action due to enhanced drug metabolism by induced enzymes, or to cellular adaptive changes [A177754]. In addition, butalbital may lead to analgesic overuse headache [A177754]. 

While butalbital is expected to mediate similar actions as other members of the barbiturate drug class, the effects of butalbital in isolation are not well understood [A177763]. It is suggested that butalbital is added in combination products to antagonize the unwanted central stimulating effect of stimulatory ingredients such as caffeine [A177763]. Butalbital may decrease blood pressure and heart rate when administered at sedative and hypnotic doses [FDA Label].","Butalbital is a CNS depressant that suppresses neuronal excitability, impulse conduction, and the release of neurotransmitters, similar to actions of other barbiturates [T598]. Barbiturates primarily mediate suppressive actions on polysynaptic neuronal responses by diminishing facilitation while enhancing inhibition [A177754]. Inhibition occurs at GABAergic synapses that express GABA-A receptors, which are transmembrane chloride ion channels that bind an inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, neurosteroids, and ethanol [A177754]. Upon activation, GABA-A receptors allow Cl- influx and K+ efflux into the postjunctional terminal, resulting in inhibition of the postsynaptic neuron. It is suggested that barbiturates, including butalbital, enhances GABA binding to the GABA-A receptors [F4561] by binding to the a+/ß- interface in the intracellular domain (ICD) as an allosteric modulator [A177829]. Additionally, barbiturates promote benzodiazepine binding to the receptor [A177754]. Barbiturates potentiate GABA-induced increases in chloride conductance and depress voltage-activated calcium currents while prolonging the duration of GABA-induced chloride channel opening [A177754]. Butalbital may also inhibit the excitatory effects mediated by AMPA receptors by reducing glutamate-induced depolarizations of the receptor [A177754]. It is also proposed that barbiturates and opioids may potentiate the analgesic effects of each other when co-administered, although there are inconsistencies across preclinical data [A177754].","Butalbital is expected to undergo nearly complete hepatic metabolism [A177754]. It primarily undergoes C5 oxidation to form 5-isobutyl-5-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) barbituric acid, which is the major metabolite. Butalbital may also undergo omega-hydroxylation to form 5-allyl-5(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-propyl) barbituric acid [A177835, Label, T598].","Butalbital gets readily and rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract [F4561]. The time to reach the peak plasma concentrations is reported to be approximately 2 hours [A177754]. Typical blood concentrations of butalbital peaked at 2.1 mg/L and declined to 1.5 mg/L at 24 hr [A177838]. Plasma concentrations of 10 to 20 µg/mL have been associated with toxicity; coma and fatalities have occurred with concentrations of 25 to 30 µg/mL [A177754].","The plasma half-life is about 35 hours. In a study of 5 healthy volunteers receiving 100 mg butalbital in combination with aspirin and caffeine, the mean plasma elimination half-life of butalbital was 61 hours, with the range of 35 to 88 hours [A177838, T598].","The _in vitro_ plasma protein binding of butalbital is 45% over the concentration range of 0.5-20 mcg/mL. This falls within the range of plasma protein binding (20%-45%) reported with other barbiturates such as phenobarbital, pentobarbital, and secobarbital sodium [FDA Label].","Butalbital predominantly undergoes renal elimination with 59 to 88% of the total dose administered being excreted from the kidneys as unchanged parent drug or metabolites [FDA Label, L6121]. Urinary excretion products included parent drug (about 3.6% of the dose), 5-isobutyl-5-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) barbituric acid (about 24% of the dose), 5-allyl-5(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-propyl) barbituric acid (about 4.8%), products with the barbituric acid ring hydrolyzed with excretion of urea (about 14% of the dose), as well as unidentified materials [FDA Label]. Of the material excreted in the urine, 32% is conjugated [FDA Label]. Elimination is not complete within 24 hours, and the drug accumulates with frequent administration [A177754].","The volume of distribution of butalbital is reported to be approximately 0.8<U+2009>L/kg [T598]. Butalbital is expected to distribute to most of the tissues in the body [F4561], including the mamillary glands and placenta [F4561].

Cladribine differs structurally from deoxyadenosine only by the presence of a chlorine atom at position 2 of the purine ring, which results in resistance to enzymatic degradation by adenosine deaminase. Due to this resistance, cladribine exhibits a more prolonged cytotoxic effect than deoxyadenosine against resting and proliferating lymphocytes.

Although the exact mechanism of action has not been fully determined, evidence shows that cladribine is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to the nucleotidecladribine triphosphate (CdATP; 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate), which accumulates and is incorporated into DNA in cells such as lymphocytes that contain high levels of deoxycytidine kinase and low levels of deoxynucleotidase, resulting in DNA strand breakage and inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair. High levels of CdATP also appear to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, which leads to an imbalance in triphosphorylated deoxynucleotide (dNTP) pools and subsequent DNA strand breaks, inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and ATP depletion, and cell death. Unlike other antimetabolite drugs, cladribine has cytotoxic effects on resting as well as proliferating lymphocytes. However, it does cause cells to accumulate at the G1/S phase junction, suggesting that cytotoxicity is associated with events critical to cell entry into S phase. It also binds purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), however no relationship between this binding and a mechanism of action has been established.","Metabolized in all cells with deoxycytidine kinase activity to 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine-5'-triphosphate","Oral bioavailability is 34 to 48%.","5.4 hours","20%",NA,"* 4.5 ± 2.8 L/kg [patients with hematologic malignancies]

The effects of ranolazine on the rectifying potassium current results in prolonged QTc and transmural dispersion of repolarization without inducing ventricular arrhythmias or torsade de pointes as this effect is contrary to the effect towards the sodium channels.[A174913]

It has been reported that ranolazine exerts significant depression of the action potential amplitude in atrial myocytes. The inhibition of sodium channels as well as potassium rectifiers produces an opposite reaction, the end effect is highly dependent on the cell type and the degree of contribution of these currents. It is known that sodium channels are greater in M cells and Purkinje fibers in which ranolazine can produce significant shortening of action potential duration. On the same point, ranolazine can produce prolonged action potential duration on epicardial cells and this combined effect on the three cells is the key point for the protective effect against ventricular arrhythmias.[A174913]

The effect of ranolazine towards fatty acid was thought to be the main mechanism of action of this therapeutic agent as the reduction of fatty acid oxidation will in order, enhance glucose oxidation, reduce production of lactic acid and improve heart function.[A174940] However, this mechanism of action was later shown to not be the major therapeutic effect-causing mechanism.

In clinical trials for stable angina (MARISA) the use of ranolazine significantly increases the exercise duration while having a negligible effect on heart rate and blood pressure.

Throughout the late seventies and the eighties, important research initiatives developed stable mesalazine formulations like the eudragit-S coating of Asacol brand mesalazine and the Pentasa brand's encapsulation of mesalazine within microgranules [A174019]. In the present day, contemporary research regarding novel methods to stabilize mesalazine continues and interest in the agent's capacity to decrease inflammatory activity and subsequently potentially reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in conditions like ulcerative colitis is maintained [A174019, A174022].","89-57-6","4Q81I59GXC",153.1354,153.042593095,"solid",1,2,0,4,"Thomas M.

Prescribing information for mesalazine in the UK also indicates the medication for the maintenance of remission of Crohn's ileo-colitis [L5101].","Mesalazine is one of the two components of sulphasalazine, the other being sulphapyridine. It is the latter which is responsible for the majority of the side effects associated with sulphasalazine therapy whilst mesalazine is known to be the active moiety in the treatment of ulcerative colitis [L5101].

The pharmacodynamic actions of mesalazine occur in the colonic/rectal mucosae local to the delivery of drug from mesalazine tablets into the lumen [FDA Label]. There is information suggesting that the severity of colonic inflammation in ulcerative colitis patients treated with mesalazine is inversely correlated with mucosal concentrations of mesalazine [FDA Label]. Plasma concentrations representing systemically absorbed mesalazine are not believed to contribute extensively to efficacy [FDA Label].","Although the mechanism of action of mesalazine is not fully understood, it is believed to possess a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells [FDA Label]. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and it is possible that mesalazine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon [FDA Label].

Furthermore, mesalazine also has the potential to inhibit the activation of Nuclear Factor kappa B (NKkB) and consequently the production of key of pro-inflammatory cytokines [FDA Label]. It has been proposed that reduced expression of PPAR gamma nuclear receptors (gamma form of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) may be implicated in ulcerative colitis [FDA Label]. There is evidence that mesalazine produces pharmacodynamic effects through direct activation of PPAR gamma receptors in the colonic/rectal epithelium as well [FDA Label].

Moreover, since increased leukocyte migration, abnormal cytokine production, increased production of arachidonic acid metabolites, particularly leukotriene B4, and increased free radical formation in the inflamed intestinal tissue are all present in patients with inflammatory bowel disease it is also believed that mesalazine has in-vitro and in-vivo pharmacological effects that inhibit leukocyte chemotaxis, decrease cytokine and leukotriene production and scavenge for free radicals [L5107].","The primary metabolite of mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is predominantly N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (Ac-5-ASA) [FDA Label].

In contrast, when mesalamine is administered orally as an unformulated 1-g aqueous suspension, mesalazine is approximately 80% absorbed [F3001].","The apparent elimination half-life documented for oral delayed-release mesalazine tablets is 7 to 12 hours [L5122].

May also be used to manage symptoms of Parkinsonian Syndrome as monotherapy during initial symptomatic management or as an adjunct to levodopa therapy during advanced stages of disease.","Cabergoline stimulates centrally-located dopaminergic receptors resulting in a number of pharmacologic effects. Five dopamine receptor types from two dopaminergic subfamilies have been identified. The dopaminergic D1 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>5</sub> subreceptors, which are associated with dyskinesias. The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>4</sub> subreceptors, which are associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. It is thought that postsynaptic D2 stimulation is primarily responsible for the antiparkinsonian effect of dopamine agonists, while presynaptic D2 stimulation confers neuroprotective effects. This semisynthetic ergot derivative exhibits potent agonist activity on dopamine D<sub>2</sub>- and D<sub>3</sub>-receptors. It also exhibits: agonist activity (in order of decreasing binding affinities) on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>2B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, dopamine D<sub>4</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, dopamine D<sub>1</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors and antagonist activity on &alpha;<sub>2B</sub>, &alpha;<sub>2A</sub>, and &alpha;<sub>2C</sub> receptors. Parkinsonian Syndrome manifests when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain is lost. As this striatum is involved in modulating the intensity of coordinated muscle activity (e.g. movement, balance, walking), loss of activity may result in dystonia (acute muscle contraction), Parkinsonism (including symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and flattened affect), akathesia (inner restlessness), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movements usually associated with long-term loss of dopaminergic activity), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which manifests when complete blockage of nigrostriatal dopamine occurs. High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions; these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain. The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonism. The tuberoinfundibular pathway of the brain originates in the hypothalamus and terminates in the pituitary gland. In this pathway, dopamine inhibits lactotrophs in anterior pituitary from secreting prolactin. Increased dopaminergic activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway inhibits prolactin secretion.","The dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor is a 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor associated with G<sub>i</sub> proteins. In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores. Decreases in intracellular calcium levels may also be brought about via inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, rather than via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally, receptor activation blocks phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and decreases MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPK appears to be mediated by c-Raf and B-Raf-dependent inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase. Dopamine-stimulated growth hormone release from the pituitary gland is mediated by a decrease in intracellular calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels rather than via adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to improvements in coordinated muscle activity in those with movement disorders. Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine receptor agonist with a high affinity for D2 receptors. Receptor-binding studies indicate that cabergoline has low affinity for dopamine D1, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>,- and &alpha;<sub>2</sub>- adrenergic, and 5-HT<sub>1</sub>- and 5-HT<sub>2</sub>-serotonin receptors.","Hepatic.

**A note regarding anti-microbial resistance**

It is important to note that doxycycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.
Up to 44 percent of strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 74 percent of Streptococcus faecalis have been found to be resistant to tetracyclines. Therefore, tetracyclines such as doxycycline should not be used to treat streptococcal infections unless the microorganism has been demonstrated to be susceptible [FDA label].","The tetracyclines, including doxycycline, are mainly bacteriostatic and are thought to exert antimicrobial effects by the inhibition of protein synthesis.   Bacteriostatic antibiotics suppress the growth of bacteria, or keep them in the stationary phase of growth [A174025]. The tetracyclines, including doxycycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms, treating numerous infectious diseases. Cross-resistance of these microorganisms to tetracyclines is a common occurrence [FDA label].   Doxycycline shows favorable intra-cellular penetration, with bacteriostatic activity on a wide range of bacteria [A174028]. Doxycycline has antiparasitic effects [A372], [A373], [A174025]. In addition to the above effects, this drug has demonstrated anti-inflammatory actions, which may help to manage inflammatory conditions such as rosacea [A174031].","In bacterial replication, an interaction that is important for translation initiation of proteins occurs at the 3' end of the 16S rRNA, found on the ribosome on the 30S subunit [A174046], [A19429],  [A174070].  The 30S subunit is the smaller subunit of the ribosome of prokaryotes, including bacteria[F3073]. 

 Tetracyclines such as doxycycline are thought to inhibit translation by binding to the 16S rRNA portion of the ribosome [A174040], preventing binding of tRNA to the RNA-30S bacterial ribosomal subunit,  which is necessary for the delivery of amino acids for protein synthesis.  As a result of the above actions, the initiation of protein synthesis by polyribosome formation is blocked. This stops the replication of bacteria and produces a bacteriostatic effect  [F3052].","Doxycycline is metabolized in the liver and gastrointestinal tract and concentrated in bile [FDA label], [F3055].
Major metabolic pathways of doxycycline have not been identified, however, enzyme inducers have been found to decrease the half-life of doxycycline [F3055].

","Tetracyclines, such as doxycycline, are readily absorbed and are bound to plasma proteins by varying degrees. Doxycycline is almost completely absorbed after oral administration. This drug is highly lipid soluble and has a low affinity for calcium binding [FDA label]. Absorption is not significantly affected by the concomitant ingestion of food or milk [F3052]. Peak serum levels of approximately 2.6 mcg/ml are reached at 2 hours following a 200 mg tablet oral dose [F3052].","16.33 hr (± 4.53 sd) [FDA label].",">90% [FDA label], [F3055].","Mainly the urine and feces as active and unchanged drug [FDA label]. Between 40% and 60% of an administered dose can be accounted for in the urine by 92 hours, and approximately 30% can be accounted for in the feces [F3055].","Doxycycline diffuses readily into most body tissues, fluid and/or cavities and the volume of distribution has been measured as 0.7 L/kg [F3052].","The excretion of doxycycline by the kidney is about 40% over 72 hours in individuals with normal kidney function (creatinine clearance approximately 75 mL/min). This rate may fall as low as 1-5% over 72 hours in individuals with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min). Some clinical studies have shown no major difference in serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18-22 hours) in patients with normal and severely impaired renal function. Hemodialysis does not affect serum half-life of doxycycline [FDA label].

**A note on tooth development and tetracycline use**

The use of tetracyclines, such as doxycycline during the first half of pregnancy as well as during certain periods in childhood up to 8 years may lead to tooth enamel hypoplasia and yellow-gray discoloration of teeth.  It is advisable not to administer doxycycline in this age group according to the FDA label, except for in cases of post-exposure cases of anthrax (including inhalational anthrax) [FDA label].  Other sources state that doxycycline should not be administered in children under 12 years [F3052].

**A note on Clostridium difficile**
Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) and antibiotic associated pseudomembranous colitis may result from doxycycline use. Administering antibacterial agents changes the normal flora of the colon leading to an overgrowth of C. difficile. This bacteria produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD [F3052]. in moderate to severe cases, therapy with a suitable oral antibacterial agent effective against Clostridium difficile should be considered. Fluids, electrolytes and protein replacement should be provided when warranted [F3052].

**A note on gastrointestinal irritation**
Gastrointestinal irritation may also occur. Rarely, esophagitis and esophageal ulcers have been reported in patients receiving doxycycline. Most of these patients took medication immediately before going to bed. Administration of appropriate amounts of fluid with the tablets is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration, and late evening ingestion of the dose should be avoided [F3052]. To decrease the risk of gastric irritation, it is recommended that doxycycline is taken with food or milk. The absorption of doxycycline is not significantly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk [F3052].


**Pregnancy**
Results of animal research indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues and exert toxic effects on the developing fetus, manifested by retardation of skeletal development. The importance of this in humans is not known, however, doxycycline should not be used in pregnant women unless the benefit significantly outweighs the risk [F3052]. 

**Carcinogenicity**
In vivo studies conducted in rats and mice have not provided conclusive evidence that tetracyclines may be carcinogenic or that they affect fertility. In two mammalian cell lines, positive tests for mutagenicity occurred at concentrations of 60 and 10 mcg/ml respectively. In humans, no association between tetracyclines and these effects have been established [F3052]."

Troche preparations are not indicated for the treatment of any systemic mycoses [FDA label].","Clotrimazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent that inhibits the growth of pathogenic yeasts by changing the permeability of cell membranes. The action of clotrimazole is fungistatic at concentrations of drug up to 20 mcg/mL and may be fungicidal _in vitro_ against Candida albicans and other species of the genus Candida at higher concentrations [FDA label]. Unfortunately, resistance to clotrimazole, which was rare in the past, is now common in various patient populations [A174094]. 

Clotrimazole is generally considered to be a fungistatic, and not a fungicidal drug, although this contrast is not absolute, as clotrimazole shows fungicidal properties at higher concentrations [A174094].

","Clotrimazole acts primarily by damaging the permeability barrier in the cell membrane of fungi. Clotrimazole causes inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, an essential constituent of fungal cell membranes. If ergosterol synthesis is either completely or partially inhibited, the cell is no longer able to construct an intact and functional cell membrane [F3088],[F3100]. Because ergosterol directly promotes the growth of fungal cells in a hormone-like fashion, rapid onset of the above events leads to dose-dependent inhibition of fungal growth [A174094].

Though decreased ergosterol, due to the inhibition of lanosterol 14-demethylase (also known as _CYP51_) [A174094] is accepted to be primarily responsible for the antimycotic properties of clotrimazole, this drug also shows other pharmacological effects. These include the inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase,  depletion of intracellular calcium, and blocking of calcium-dependent potassium channels and voltage-dependent calcium channels [A174094].

Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus.

**Effects on blood pressure**

Clinical experience with dopamine agonists, including ropinirole, suggests an association with impaired abilities in regulating blood pressure with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially with patients undergoing dose escalation. In some patients in clinical studies, blood pressure changes were associated with orthostatic symptoms, bradycardia, and, in one case in a healthy volunteer, transient sinus arrest accompanied by syncope [FDA label]. The mechanism of orthostatic hypotension caused by ropinirole is assumed to be due to a D2-mediated blunting of noradrenergic response to a standing position, followed by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance.

This system affects body movement.  Negligible affinity is seen for ropinirole at a2 adrenoreceptors in the periphery and 5HT-1 receptor. Ropinirole has no affinity at the D1-like receptors, benzodiazepine or GABA receptors [A35711].

There was an increase in testicular Leydig cell adenomas at all doses tested in rats.  The hormonal mechanisms thought to be involved in the development of these tumors in rats are not considered relevant to humans. In mice, there was an increase in benign uterine endometrial polyps at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The highest dose not associated with this observation (15 mg/kg/day) is three times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis [FDA label].

It may be used alone or concurrently with thiazide-type diuretics.","Isradipine decreases arterial smooth muscle contractility and subsequent vasoconstriction by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions through L-type calcium channels. Calcium ions entering the cell through these channels bind to calmodulin. Calcium-bound calmodulin then binds to and activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Activated MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin, a key step in muscle contraction. Signal amplification is achieved by calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. Inhibition of the initial influx of calcium decreases the contractile activity of arterial smooth muscle cells and results in vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of isradipine result in an overall decrease in blood pressure.","Isradipine belongs to the dihydropyridine (DHP) class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the most widely used class of CCBs. There are at least five different types of calcium channels in <i>Homo sapiens</i>: L-, N-, P/Q-, R- and T-type. CCBs target L-type calcium channels, the major channel in muscle cells that mediates contraction. Similar to other DHP CCBs, isradipine binds directly to inactive calcium channels stabilizing their inactive conformation. Since arterial smooth muscle depolarizations are longer in duration than cardiac muscle depolarizations, inactive channels are more prevalent in smooth muscle cells. Alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel gives isradipine additional arterial selectivity.

A seizure is an abnormal, unregulated electrical discharge occurring in the brain's cortical gray matter. This electrical response produces a transient interruption in the normal brain function which in order produces altered awareness, abnormal sensations, focal involuntary movements or convulsions. The type of seizure can be classified according to the type of onset followed by a type of seizure.[L5548]

In particular, lidocaine's principal mode of action in acting as a local anesthetic that numbs the sensations of tissues means the agent is indicated for facilitating local anesthesia for a large variety of surgical procedures [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It ultimately elicits its numbing activity by blocking sodium channels so that the neurons of local tissues that have the medication applied on are transiently incapable of signaling the brain regarding sensations [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In doing so, however, it can block or decrease muscle contractile, resulting in effects like vasodilation, hypotension, and irregular heart rate, among others [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, lidocaine is also considered a class Ib anti-arrhythmic agent [L5930, L5948, F4468]. Nevertheless, lidocaine's local anesthetic action sees its use in many medical situations or circumstances that may benefit from its action, including the treatment of premature ejaculation [A177625].

Regardless, lidocaine is currently available as a relatively non-expensive generic medication that is written for in millions of prescriptions internationally on a yearly basis. It is even included in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines [L6055].","137-58-6","98PI200987",234.3373,234.173213336,"solid",2,5,1,3,NA,"Lidocaine is an anesthetic of the amide group indicated for production of local or regional anesthesia by infiltration techniques such as percutaneous injection and intravenous regional anesthesia by peripheral nerve block techniques such as brachial plexus and intercostal and by central neural techniques such as lumbar and caudal epidural blocks [F4349, L5930].","Excessive blood levels of lidocaine can cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure [F4349, L5930]. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to the block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present [F4349, L5930]. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded [F4349, L5930].

In particular, such cardiac effects are likely associated with the principal effect that lidocaine elicits when it binds and blocks sodium channels, inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of electrical action potential impulses necessary to facilitate muscle contraction [F4349, L5930, L5948]. Subsequently, in cardiac myocytes, lidocaine can potentially block or otherwise slow the rise of cardiac action potentials and their associated cardiac myocyte contractions, resulting in possible effects like hypotension, bradycardia, myocardial depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and perhaps cardiac arrest or circulatory collapse [F4349, L5930, L5948].

Moreover, lidocaine possesses a dissociation constant (pKa) of 7.7 and is considered a weak base [L5948]. As a result, about 25% of lidocaine molecules will be un-ionized and available at the physiological pH of 7.4 to translocate inside nerve cells, which means lidocaine elicits an onset of action more rapidly than other local anesthetics that have higher pKa values [L5948]. This rapid onset of action is demonstrated in about one minute following intravenous injection and fifteen minutes following intramuscular injection [L5930]. The administered lidocaine subsequently spreads rapidly through the surrounding tissues and the anesthetic effect lasts approximately ten to twenty minutes when given intravenously and about sixty to ninety minutes after intramuscular injection [L5930].

Nevertheless, it appears that the efficacy of lidocaine may be minimized in the presence of inflammation [L5948]. This effect could be due to acidosis decreasing the amount of un-ionized lidocaine molecules, a more rapid reduction in lidocaine concentration as a result of increased blood flow, or potentially also because of increased production of inflammatory mediators like peroxynitrite that elicit direct actions on sodium channels [L5948].","Lidocaine is a local anesthetic of the amide type [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It is used to provide local anesthesia by nerve blockade at various sites in the body [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It does so by stabilizing the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In particular, the lidocaine agent acts on sodium ion channels located on the internal surface of nerve cell membranes [F4349, L5930, L5948]. At these channels, neutral uncharged lidocaine molecules diffuse through neural sheaths into the axoplasm where they are subsequently ionized by joining with hydrogen ions [F4349, L5930, L5948]. The resultant lidocaine cations are then capable of reversibly binding the sodium channels from the inside, keeping them locked in an open state that prevents nerve depolarization [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, with sufficient blockage, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will ultimately not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential [F4349, L5930, L5948]. This facilitates an anesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain but by aborting their generation in the first place [F4349, L5930, L5948].

In addition to blocking conduction in nerve axons in the peripheral nervous system, lidocaine has important effects on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system [F4349, L5930, L5948]. After absorption, lidocaine may cause stimulation of the CNS followed by depression and in the cardiovascular system, it acts primarily on the myocardium where it may produce decreases in electrical excitability, conduction rate, and force of contraction [F4349, L5930, L5948].","Lidocaine is metabolized predominantly and rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys [F4349, L5930]. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation [F4349, L5930]. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide [F4349, L5930]. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine HCl [F4349, L5930]. Approximately 90% of lidocaine HCl administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged [F4349, L5930]. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline [F4349, L5930].","In general, lidocaine is readily absorbed across mucous membranes and damaged skin but poorly through intact skin [F4468]. The agent is quickly absorbed from the upper airway, tracheobronchial tree, and alveoli into the bloodstream [F4468]. And although lidocaine is also well absorbed across the gastrointestinal tract the oral bioavailability is only about 35% as a result of a high degree of first-pass metabolism [F4468]. After injection into tissues, lidocaine is also rapidly absorbed and the absorption rate is affected by both vascularity and the presence of tissue and fat capable of binding lidocaine in the particular tissues [F4468].

The concentration of lidocaine in the blood is subsequently affected by a variety of aspects, including its rate of absorption from the site of injection, the rate of tissue distribution, and the rate of metabolism and excretion [F4349, L5930, L5948]. Subsequently, the systemic absorption of lidocaine is determined by the site of injection, the dosage given, and its pharmacological profile [F4349, L5930, L5948]. The maximum blood concentration occurs following intercostal nerve blockade followed in order of decreasing concentration, the lumbar epidural space, brachial plexus site, and subcutaneous tissue [F4349, L5930, L5948]. The total dose injected regardless of the site is the primary determinant of the absorption rate and blood levels achieved [F4349, L5930, L5948]. There is a linear relationship between the amount of lidocaine injected and the resultant peak anesthetic blood levels [F4349, L5930, L5948].

Nevertheless, it has been observed that lidocaine hydrochloride is completely absorbed following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending also on lipid solubility and the presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent [F4349, L5930, L5948]. Except for intravascular administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous administration [F4349, L5930, L5948].

Additionally, lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion [F4349].","The elimination half-life of lidocaine hydrochloride following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2.0 hours [F4349]. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine HCl kinetics [F4349]. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction [F4349].","The protein binding recorded for lidocaine is about 60 to 80% and is dependent upon the plasma concentration of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein [F4349, L5948]. Such percentage protein binding bestows lidocaine with a medium duration of action when placed in comparison to other local anesthetic agents [L5948].","The excretion of unchanged lidocaine and its metabolites occurs predominantly via the kidney with less than 5% in the unchanged form appearing in the urine [F4349, L5930]. The renal clearance is inversely related to its protein binding affinity and the pH of the urine [L5930]. This suggests by the latter that excretion of lidocaine occurs by non-ionic diffusion [L5930].","The volume of distribution determined for lidocaine is 0.7 to 1.5 L/kg [L5948].

In particular, lidocaine is distributed throughout the total body water [L5930]. Its rate of disappearance from the blood can be described by a two or possibly even three-compartment model [L5930]. There is a rapid disappearance (alpha phase) which is believed to be related to uptake by rapidly equilibrating tissues (tissues with high vascular perfusion, for example) [L5930]. The slower phase is related to distribution to slowly equilibrating tissues (beta phase) and to its metabolism and excretion (gamma phase) [L5930].

Lidocaine's distribution is ultimately throughout all body tissues [L5930]. In general, the more highly perfused organs will show higher concentrations of the agent [L5930]. The highest percentage of this drug will be found in skeletal muscle, mainly due to the mass of muscle rather than an affinity [L5930].","The mean systemic clearance observed for intravenously administered lidocaine in a study of 15 adults was approximately 0.64 +/- 0.18 L/min [F4444].","After Burn Double Strength GelAfter Burn Double Strength SprayAfter Burn GelAfter Burn SprayAlphacaineAnestacon JellyDermaFlexDilocaineEsracaineL-CaineLidoject-1Lidoject-2LidoPain SPNorwood Sunburn Spray",2,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00281.pdf?1265922813","//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00281.pdf?1265922749",0,1251,"Symptoms of overdose and/or acute systemic toxicity involves central nervous system toxicity that presents with symptoms of increasing severity [L5930]. Patients may present initially with circumoral paraesthesia, numbness of the tongue, light-headedness, hyperacusis, and tinnitus [L5930]. Visual disturbance and muscular tremors or muscle twitching are more serious and precede the onset of generalized convulsions [L5930]. These signs must not be mistaken for neurotic behavior [L5930]. Unconsciousness and grand mal convulsions may follow, which may last from a few seconds to several minutes [L5930]. Hypoxia and hypercapnia occur rapidly following convulsions due to increased muscular activity, together with the interference with normal respiration and loss of the airway [L5930]. In severe cases, apnoea may occur. Acidosis increases the toxic effects of local anesthetics [L5930]. Effects on the cardiovascular system may be seen in severe cases [L5930]. Hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmia and cardiac arrest may occur as a result of high systemic concentrations, with potentially fatal outcome [L5930].

Pregnancy Category B has been established for the use of lidocaine in pregnancy, although there are no formal, adequate, and well-controlled studies in pregnant women [F4349]. General consideration should be given to this fact before administering lidocaine to women of childbearing potential, especially during early pregnancy when maximum organogenesis takes place [F4349]. Ultimately, although animal studies have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus, lidocaine should not be administered during early pregnancy unless the benefits are considered to outweigh the risks [L5930]. Lidocaine readily crosses the placental barrier after epidural or intravenous administration to the mother [L5930]. The ratio of umbilical to maternal venous concentration is 0.5 to 0.6 [L5930]. The fetus appears to be capable of metabolizing lidocaine at term [L5930]. The elimination half-life in the newborn of the drug received in utero is about three hours, compared with 100 minutes in the adult [L5930]. Elevated lidocaine levels may persist in the newborn for at least 48 hours after delivery [L5930]. Fetal bradycardia or tachycardia, neonatal bradycardia, hypotonia or respiratory depression may occur [L5930].

Local anesthetics rapidly cross the placenta and when used for epidural, paracervical, pudendal or caudal block anesthesia, can cause varying degrees of maternal, fetal and neonatal toxicity [F4349]. The potential for toxicity depends upon the procedure performed, the type and amount of drug used, and the technique of drug administration [F4349]. Adverse reactions in the parturient, fetus and neonate involve alterations of the central nervous system, peripheral vascular tone, and cardiac function [F4349].

Maternal hypotension has resulted from regional anesthesia [F4349]. Local anesthetics produce vasodilation by blocking sympathetic nerves [F4349]. Elevating the patient’s legs and positioning her on her left side will help prevent decreases in blood pressure [F4349]. The fetal heart rate also should be monitored continuously, and electronic fetal monitoring is highly advisable [F4349].

Epidural, spinal, paracervical, or pudendal anesthesia may alter the forces of parturition through changes in uterine contractility or maternal expulsive efforts [F4349]. In one study, paracervical block anesthesia was associated with a decrease in the mean duration of first stage labor and facilitation of cervical dilation [F4349]. However, spinal and epidural anesthesia have also been reported to prolong the second stage of labor by removing the parturient’s reflex urge to bear down or by interfering with motor function [F4349]. The use of obstetrical anesthesia may increase the need for forceps assistance [F4349].

The use of some local anesthetic drug products during labor and delivery may be followed by diminished muscle strength and tone for the first day or two of life [F4349]. The long-term significance of these observations is unknown [F4349]. Fetal bradycardia may occur in 20 to 30 percent of patients receiving paracervical nerve block anesthesia with the amide-type local anesthetics and may be associated with fetal acidosis [F4349]. Fetal heart rate should always be monitored during paracervical anesthesia [F4349]. The physician should weigh the possible advantages against risks when considering a paracervical block in prematurity, toxemia of pregnancy, and fetal distress [F4349]. Careful adherence to the recommended dosage is of the utmost importance in obstetrical paracervical block [F4349]. Failure to achieve adequate analgesia with recommended doses should arouse suspicion of intravascular or fetal intracranial injection [F4349]. Cases compatible with unintended fetal intracranial injection of local anesthetic solution have been reported following intended paracervical or pudendal block or both. Babies so affected present with unexplained neonatal depression at birth, which correlates with high local anesthetic serum levels, and often manifest seizures within six hours [F4349]. Prompt use of supportive measures combined with forced urinary excretion of the local anesthetic has been used successfully to manage this complication [F4349].

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk [F4349]. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when lidocaine is administered to a nursing woman [F4349].

Dosages in children should be reduced, commensurate with age, body weight and physical condition [F4349].

Pamidronate adsorbs to calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) crystals in bone and may directly block dissolution of this mineral component of bone. In vitro studies also suggest that inhibition of osteoclast activity contributes to inhibition of bone resorption. Pamidronate also targets farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (such as pamidronate, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate and zoledronate) appear to act as analogues of isoprenoid diphosphate lipids, thereby inhibiting FPP synthase, an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of this enzyme in osteoclasts prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids (FPP and GGPP) that are essential for the post-translational farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPase signalling proteins.

Venlafaxine has also been shown to weakly inhibit dopamine reuptake. Neither venlafaxine nor ODV bind to muscarinic, histaminergic, or alpha-1 adrenergic receptors[FDA Label]; pharmacologic activity at these receptors is hypothesized to be associated with the various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects seen with other psychotropic drugs.

The conjugated estrogen product contains a mix of estrogen from which about 50% is represented by estrone sulfate followed by 25% of equilin sulfate, 15% of 17-alpha-dehydroequilenin sulfate, 3% of equilenin sulfate, 5% of 17-alpha and 17-beta-dihydroequilenin sulfate, 2% of 17-alpha-estradiolsulfate and 3% of 17-beta-estradiolsulfate.

In preclinical studies, the conjugated estrogens are known to have a similar estrogenic potency than estrone and the equilin components of the conjugated estrogens have similar potency in the liver when compared to bioidentical estradiol.[A35765] It has also been tested and confirmed that conjugated estrogens present a selective estrogen receptor modulator profile which allows it to have a large beneficial effect on the bone and cardiovascular system.[A175597]

Clinically, the administration of conjugated estrogens is known to promote vasomotor stability, maintain genitourinary function, and normal growth and development of female sex hormones.

The activity made by the conjugated estrogens is driven by the increase in the synthesis of DNA, RNA and various proteins in responsive tissues which in order will reduce the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and leuteinizing hormone.[T147]

One of the metabolic pathways of the conjugated estrogens is driven by the action of the cytochrome isoenzyme CYP3A4.[A175552] On the other hand, the conjugated estrogens can also be processed by a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversion and sulfate conjugation. Some of the principal metabolic reactions of the conjugated estrogens are driven by the conversion of 17beta-estradiol to estrone and the further change to estriol. A portion of the administered conjugated estrogens will remain in the blood as sulfate conjugates which serve as a circulating reservoir for the generation of new estrogens.[A38238]

In the endometrium, equilin is metabolized to 2-hydroxy and 4-hydroxy equilin as well as 2-hydroxy and 4-hydroxy estradiol.

The topical corticosteroids constitute a class of primarily synthetic steroids used as anti-inflammatory and antipruritic agents. Amcinonide reduces or inhibits the actions of chemicals in the body that cause inflammation, redness, and swelling. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. When in an ointment form, amcinonide also helps the skin maintain moisture.","The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear.

Also known as the marketed product Strattera, atomoxetine is used with other treatment modalities (psychological, educational, cognitive behaviour therapy, etc) to improve developmentally inappropriate symptoms associated with ADHD including distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. Although the underlying pathophysiology that causes ADHD remains unclear, evidence suggests that dysregulation in noradrenergic and dopaminergic pathways plays a critical role in suboptimal executive functioning within prefrontal regions of the brain, which are involved in attention and memory [A178090]. Atomoxetine has been shown to specifically increase NA and DA within the prefrontal cortex, but not in the nucleus accumbens (NA) or striatum [A18262]. This is beneficial in the treatment of ADHD as DA activation in the subcortical NA and striatum is associated with many stimulant-associated side effects and an increase in abuse potential, which is a limiting factor associated with the use of stimulant medications such as [DB00422], [DB01576], and [DB01255] [A18262]. Use of non-stimulant medications such as atomoxetine is therefore thought to offer a clinical advantage over the use of traditional medications for the management of ADHD. More recently, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in rhesus monkeys have shown that atomoxetine also binds to the serotonin transporter (SERT)[A178111], and blocks the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor [A18263], indicating a role for the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of ADHD. 

Long-acting formulations of psychostimulants (such as [DB00422], [DB01576], and [DB01255]) are typically considered the most effective and first-line treatment for ADHD in adults and children as recommended by CADDRA (Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance) [L6037]. However, these stimulant medications are limited by dose-related side effects and concerns of abuse. Many contain a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. In particular, increased dopamine in key areas caused by these stimulant medications is associated with their reinforcing and addictive properties, and even amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of other drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, making ADHD sufferers more susceptible to their addictive effects[A177556]. Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DA and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including atomoxetine, [DB00745] and [DB01018]. The non-stimulant norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitor [DB01156] (commonly used for the treatment of depression and for smoking cessation) has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of ADHD [A178099].","83015-26-3","ASW034S0B8",255.3547,255.162314299,"solid",1,10,3,3,NA,"Atomoxetine is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults.","Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Atomoxetine has been shown to specifically increase norepinephrine and dopamine within the prefrontal cortex, which results in improved ADHD symptoms.[A18262, A18262, F4639]

Due to atomoxetine's noradrenergic activity, it also has effects on the cardiovascular system such as increased blood pressure and tachycardia [T244]. Sudden deaths, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in patients taking atomoxetine at usual doses for ADHD. Atomoxetine should be used with caution in patients whose underlying medical conditions could be worsened by increases in blood pressure or heart rate such as certain patients with hypertension, tachycardia, or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. It should not be used in patients with severe cardiac or vascular disorders whose condition would be expected to deteriorate if they experienced clinically important increases in blood pressure or heart rate. Although the role of atomoxetine in these cases is unknown, consideration should be given to not treating patients with clinically significant cardiac abnormalities. Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during atomoxetine treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation.[F4639]

In general, particular care should be taken in treating ADHD in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder because of concern for possible induction of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Treatment emergent psychotic or manic symptoms, e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania in children and adolescents without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania can be caused by atomoxetine at usual doses. If such symptoms occur, consideration should be given to a possible causal role of atomoxetine, and discontinuation of treatment should be considered.[F4639]

Atomoxetine capsules increased the risk of suicidal ideation in short-term studies in children and adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). All pediatric patients being treated with atomoxetine  should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.[F4639]

Postmarketing reports indicate that atomoxetine can cause severe liver injury. Although no evidence of liver injury was detected in clinical trials of about 6000 patients, there have been rare cases of clinically significant liver injury that were considered probably or possibly related to atomoxetine use in postmarketing experience. Rare cases of liver failure have also been reported, including a case that resulted in a liver transplant. Atomoxetine should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or laboratory evidence of liver injury, and should not be restarted. Laboratory testing to determine liver enzyme levels should be done upon the first symptom or sign of liver dysfunction (e.g., pruritus, dark urine, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, or unexplained “flu like” symptoms).[F4639]","Atomoxetine is known to be a potent and selective inhibitor of the norepinephrine transporter (NET)[A175723], which prevents cellular reuptake of norepinephrine throughout the brain, which is thought to improve the symptoms of ADHD. More recently, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in rhesus monkeys have shown that atomoxetine also binds to the serotonin transporter (SERT)[A178111], and blocks the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor [A18263], indicating a role for the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of ADHD.","Atomoxetine undergoes biotransformation primarily through the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzymatic pathway. People with reduced activity in the CYP2D6 pathway (also known as poor metabolizers or PMs) have higher plasma concentrations of atomoxetine compared with people with normal activity (also known as extensive metabolizers, or EMs). For PMs, the AUC of atomoxetine at steady-state is approximately 10-fold higher and Cmax is about 5-fold greater than for EMs. 

The major oxidative metabolite formed regardless of CYP2D6 status is 4-hydroxy-atomoxetine, which is rapidly glucuronidated. 4-Hydroxyatomoxetine is equipotent to atomoxetine as an inhibitor of the norepinephrine transporter, but circulates in plasma at much lower concentrations (1% of atomoxetine concentration in EMs and 0.1% of atomoxetine concentration in PMs). 

In individuals that lack CYP2D6 activity, 4-hydroxyatomoxetine is still the primary metabolite, but is formed by several other cytochrome P450 enzymes and at a slower rate. Another minor metabolite, N-Desmethyl-atomoxetine is formed by CYP2C19 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes, but has much less pharmacological activity than atomoxetine and lower plasma concentrations (5% of atomoxetine concentration in EMs and 45% of atomoxetine concentration in PMs).[F4639]","The pharmacokinetic profile of atomoxetine is highly dependent on cytochrome P450 2D6 genetic polymorphisms of the individual [A175669]. A large fraction of the population (up to 10% of Caucasians and 2% of people of African descent and 1% of Asians) are poor metabolizers (PMs) of CYP2D6 metabolized drugs. These individuals have reduced activity in this pathway resulting in 10-fold higher AUCs, 5-fold higher peak plasma concentrations, and slower elimination (plasma half-life of 21.6 hours) of atomoxetine compared with people with normal CYP2D6 activity.

Atomoxetine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with absolute bioavailability of about 63% in extensive metabolizers (EMs) and 94% in poor metabolizers (PMs). Mean maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing with a maximal concentration of 350 ng/ml with an AUC of 2 mcg.h/ml[A175669].
","The reported half-life depends on the CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms of the individual and can range from 3 to 5.6 hours.[A175669]","At therapeutic concentrations, 98.7% of plasma atomoxetine is bound to protein, with 97.5% of that being bound to albumin, followed by alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and immunoglobulin G[A175669].","Atomoxetine is excreted primarily as 4-hydroxyatomoxetine-O-glucuronide, mainly in the urine (greater than 80% of the dose) and to a lesser extent in the feces (less than 17% of the dose).

","For the production of local or regional anesthesia or analgesia for surgery, for oral surgery procedures, for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and for obstetrical procedures.","Bupivacaine is a widely used local anesthetic agent. Bupivacaine is often administered by spinal injection prior to total hip arthroplasty. It is also commonly injected into surgical wound sites to reduce pain for up to 20 hours after surgery. In comparison to other local anesthetics it has a long duration of action. It is also the most toxic to the heart when administered in large doses. This problem has led to the use of other long-acting local anaesthetics:ropivacaine and levobupivacaine. Levobupivacaine is a derivative, specifically an enantiomer, of bupivacaine. Systemic absorption of local anesthetics produces effects on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. At blood concentrations achieved with therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias and to cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in fatalities. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. Following systemic absorption, local anesthetics can produce central nervous system stimulation, depression or both.","Local anesthetics such as bupivacaine block the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. Bupivacaine prevents depolarization by bindng to the intracellular portion of sodium channels and blocking sodium ion influx into neurons. In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone. The analgesic effects of Bupivicaine are thought to potentially be due to its binding to the prostaglandin E2 receptors, subtype EP1 (PGE2EP1), which inhibits the production of prostaglandins, thereby reducing fever, inflammation, and hyperalgesia.","Amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized primarily in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid. The major metabolite of bupivacaine is 2,6-pipecoloxylidine, which is mainly catalyzed via cytochrome P450 3A4.","Systemic absorption of local anesthetics is dose- and concentration-dependendent on the total drug administered. Other factors that affect the rate of systemic absorption include the route of administration, blood flow at the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic solution.","2.7 hours in adults and 8.1 hours in neonates","95%","Only 6% of bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine.",NA,NA,"BupivanSunCarbostesinAstraZenecaMarcainAstraZenecaMarcainaAstraZenecaSensorcaine-MPFAstra Zeneca",0,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00297.pdf?1265922814","//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00297.pdf?1265922750",0,952,"The mean seizure dosage of bupivacaine in rhesus monkeys was found to be 4.4 mg/kg with mean arterial plasma concentration of 4.5 mcg/mL.

Recent clinical data from patients experiencing local anesthetic induced convulsions demonstrated rapid development of hypoxia, hypercarbia, and acidosis with bupivacaine within a minute of the onset of convulsions. These observations suggest that oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production are greatly increased during local anesthetic convulsions and emphasize the importance of immediate and effective ventilation with oxygen which may avoid cardiac arrest."

**A note on resistance**

Administration of tenofovir disoproxil 300 mg tablets after a high-fat meal increases the oral bioavailability of this drug, as demonstrated by an increase in tenofovir AUC0-8 of about 40% as well as an increase in Cmax of about 14%.  On the contrary, the administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a light meal did not exert a relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir when compared to administration under fasting conditions.  The presence of ingested food slows the time to tenofovir Cmax by approximately  1 hour.

**Carcinogenesis**

Long-term oral carcinogenicity studies of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in mice and rats were performed at exposures up to approximately 16 times (mice) and 5 times (rats) those observed in humans at the therapeutic dose for HIV-1 infection. At the higher dose in female mice, liver adenomas were increased at exposures 16 times that in humans. In rats, the study was negative for carcinogenic findings at exposures up to 5 times that observed in humans at the therapeutic dose [FDA label]. 

**Pregnancy**

This drug is considered a pregnancy Category B drug. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 14 and 19 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area comparisons and revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to tenofovir. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  

Because animal reproduction studies are not consistently reflective of human effects, tenofovir disoproxil should be used during pregnancy only if clearly required. To monitor fetal outcomes of pregnant women taking tenofovir disoproxil, an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been formed. Healthcare providers are encouraged and advised to register patients by calling the number listed on the FDA label for tenofovir disoproxil [FDA label].

**Mutagenesis**

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was mutagenic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and negative for mutagenesis in an in vitro bacterial mutagenicity test (Ames test). In an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was negative when administered to male mice.

**Impairment of Fertility**

There were no observed effects on fertility, mating performance or early embryonic development when tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was given to male rats at a dose comparable to 10 times the human dose based on body surface area comparisons for 28 days before mating and to female rats for 15 days before mating through day seven of gestation. There was, however, changes in the estrous cycle in female rats [FDA label].

Chlorthalidone is considered first-line therapy for management of uncomplicated hypertension as there is strong evidence from meta-analyses that thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone reduce the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension[A173863].

3) Emergency treatment of status epilepticus.[A177955]","Valproate has been shown to reduce the incidence of complex partial seizures and migraine headaches.[FDA Label,A177841] It also improves symptom control in bipolar mania.[A178033] Although the exact mechanisms responsible are unknown, it is thought that valproate produces increased cortical inhibition to contribute to control of neural synchrony. It is also thought that valproate exerts a neuroprotective effect preventing damage and neural degeneration in epilepsy, migraines, and bipolar disorder.

Valproate is hepatotoxic and teratogenic. The reasons for this are unclear but have been attributed to the genomic effects of the drug.[A457]

A small proof-of concept study found that valproate increases clearance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) when combined with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) by reactivating the virus to allow clearance, however, a larger multicentre trial failed to show a significant effect on HIV reservoirs when added to HAART.[A458,A177859] The FDA labeling contains a warning regarding HIV reactivation during valproate use.[label].","The exact mechanisms by which valproate exerts it's effects on epilepsy, migraine headaches, and bipolar disorder are unknown however several pathways exist which may contribute to the drug's action.

Valproate is known to inhibit succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase.[A177991] This inhibition results in an increase in succinic semialdehyde which acts as an inhibitor of GABA transaminase ultimately reducing GABA metabolism and increasing GABAergic neurotransmission. As GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, this increase results in increased inhibitory activity.[A457] A possible secondary contributor to cortical inhibition is a direct suppression of voltage gated sodium channel activity and indirect suppression through effects on GABA.

It has also been suggested that valproate impacts the extracellular signal-related kinase pathway (ERK).[A457] These effects appear to be dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) and result in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. This activation increases expression of several downstream targets including ELK-1 with subsequent increases in c-fos, growth cone-associated protein-43 which contributes to neural plasticity, B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 which is an anti-apoptotic protein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is also involved in neural plasticity and growth. Increased neurogenesis and neurite growth due to valproate are attributed to the effects of this pathway. An additional downstream effect of increased BDNF expression appears to be an increase in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors which contribute further to increased GABAergic activity.[A177997]

Valproate exerts a non-competitive indirect inhibitory effect on myo-inosital-1-phophate synthetase.[A178000] This results in reduced de novo synthesis of inositol monophosphatase and subsequent inositol depletion. It is unknown how this contributed to valproate's effects on bipolar disorder but [lithium] is known to exert a similar inositol-depleting effect.[A178003] Valproate exposure also appears to produce down-regulation of protein kinase C proteins (PKC)-a and -e which are potentially related to bipolar disorder as PKC is unregulated in the frontal cortex of bipolar patients. This is further supported by a similar reduction in PKC with lithium.[A178015] The inhibition of the PKC pathway may also be a contributor to migraine prophylaxis.[A178018] Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, a PKC substrate, is also downregulated by valproate and may contribute to changes in synaptic remodeling through effects on the cytoskeleton.[A178021]

Valproate also appears to impact fatty acid metabolism.[A457] Less incorporation of fatty acid substrates in sterols and glycerolipids is thought to impact membrane fluidity and result in increased action potential threshold potentially contributing to valproate's antiepileptic action.[A178024] Valproate has been found to be a non-competitive direct inhibitor of brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase.[A14708] Inhibition of this enzyme decreases available arichidonyl-CoA, a substrate in the production of inflammatory prostaglandins. It is thought that this may be a mechanism behind valproate's efficacy in migraine prophylaxis as migraines are routinely treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which also inhibit prostaglandin production.

Finally, valproate acts as a direct histone deactylase (HDAC) inhibitor.[A178030] Hyperacetylation of lysine residues on histones promoted DNA relaxation and allows for increased gene transcription. The scope of valproate's genomic effects is wide with 461 genes being up or down-regulated.[A178027] The relation of these genomic effects to therapeutic value is not fully characterized however H3 and H4 hyperacetylation correlates with improvement of symptoms in bipolar patients.[A178033] Histone hyperacetylation at the BDNF gene, increasing BDNF expression, post-seizure is known to occur and is thought to be a neuroprotective mechanism which valproate may strengthen or prolong.[A178036] H3 hyperacetylation is associated with a reduction in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a pro-apoptotic enzyme, contributing further to valproate's neuroprotective effects.[A11814]","Most drug is metabolized to glucuronide conjugates (30-50%) of the parent drug or of metabolites.[Label,A178066] Another large portion is metabolized through mitochondrial ß-oxidation (40%). The remainder of metabolism (15-20%) occurs through oxidation, hydroxylation, and dehydrogenation at the <U+03C9>, <U+03C9><sub>1</sub>, and <U+03C9><sub>2</sub> positions resulting in the formation of hydroxyls, ketones, carboxyls, a lactone metabolite, double bonds, and combinations.","The intravenous and oral forms of valproic acid are expected to produce the same AUC, Cmax, and Cmin at steady-state.[label] The oral delayed-release tablet formulation has a Tmax of 4 hours. Differences in absorption rate are expected from other formulations but are not considered to be clinically important in the context of chronic therapy beyond impacting frequency of dosing.

Symptoms of overdose include somnolence, heart block, deep coma, and hypernatremia. Fatalities have been reported, however patients have recovered from valproate serum concentrations as high as 2120 mcg/mL. The unbound fraction may be removed by hemodialysis. Naloxone has been demonstrated to reverse the CNS depressant effects of overdose but may also reverse the anti-epileptic effects.[FDA Label]

**Reproductive Toxicity**

Valproate use in pregnancy is known to increase the risk of neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities.[FDA Label] The risk of spina bifida increases from 0.06-0.07% in the normal population to 1-2% in valproate users. The North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED)
Pregnancy Registry reports a major malformation rate of 9-11%, 5 times the baseline rate. These malformations include neural tube defects, cardiovascular malformations, craniofacial defects (e.g., oral clefts, craniosynostosis), hypospadias, limb malformations (e.g., clubfoot, polydactyly), and other malformations of varying severity involving other body systems. Other antiepileptic drugs, lamotrigine, carbemazepine, and phenytoin, have been found to reduce IQ in children exposed in utero. Valproate was also studied however the results did not achieve statistical significance (97 IQ (CI: 94-101)). Observational studies report an absolute risk increase of 2.9% (relative risk 2.9 times baseline) of autism spectrum disorder in children exposed to valproate in utero. There have been case reports of fatal hepatic failure in children of mothers who used valproate during pregnancy.

There have been reports of male infertility when taking valproate.[FDA Label]

**Lactation**

Valproate is excreted in human milk.[FDA Label] Data in the published literature describe the presence of valproate in human milk (range: 0.4 mcg/mL to 3.9 mcg/mL), corresponding to 1% to 10% of maternal serum levels. Valproate serum concentrations collected from breastfed infants aged 3 days postnatal to 12 weeks following delivery ranged from 0.7 mcg/mL to 4 mcg/mL, which were 1% to 6% of maternal serum valproate levels. A published study in children up to six years of age did not report adverse developmental or cognitive effects following exposure to valproate
via breast milk.

It is also used for its antipyretic effects, helping to reduce fever [F4124]. This drug was initially approved by the U.S. FDA in 1951 [FDA label] and is available in a variety of forms including syrup form, regular tablets, effervescent tablets, injection, suppository, and other forms [L5756, L5774, F4124], [FDA label].  

Acetaminophen is often found combined with other drugs in more than 600 over the counter (OTC) allergy medications, cold medications, sleep medications, pain relievers, and other products [L5783]. Confusion about dosing of this drug may be caused by the availability of different formulas, strengths, and dosage instructions for children of different ages [L5783].  Due to the possibility of fatal overdose and liver failure associated with the incorrect use of acetaminophen, it is important to follow current and available national and manufacturer dosing guidelines while this drug is taken or prescribed [L5786, L5789], [FDA label].","103-90-2","362O9ITL9D",151.1626,151.063328537,"solid",1,13,1,7,"Jeffrey L.

Because of its low risk of causing allergic reactions, this drug can be administered in patients who are intolerant to salicylates and those with allergic tendencies, including bronchial asthmatics [F4124]. Specific dosing guidelines should be followed when administering acetaminophen to children [L5780].","Animal and clinical studies have determined that acetaminophen has both antipyretic and analgesic effects. This drug has been shown to lack anti-inflammatory effects. As opposed to the _salicylate_ drug class, acetaminophen does not disrupt tubular secretion of uric acid and does not affect acid-base balance if taken at the recommended doses [F4124]. Acetaminophen does not disrupt hemostasis and does not have inhibitory activities against platelet aggregation [FDA label], [F4124]. Allergic reactions are rare occurrences following acetaminophen use [F4124].","Although acetaminophen's exact mechanism of action has not been fully established, according to the FDA label [FDA label], it is categorized as an NSAID (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) due to that fact that it inhibits the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways [T518], and it is thought to exert central actions which ultimately lead to the alleviation of pain symptoms [FDA label]. 

One theory is that acetaminophen increases the pain threshold by inhibiting two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2, which are involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Prostaglandins are responsible for eliciting pain sensations [A176366]. Acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, therefore, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory effects. Though acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the active site of this enzyme, studies have shown that acetaminophen (paracetamol) blocks COX indirectly [F4133].  Studies also suggest that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant type of the COX enzyme [A468] that is unique from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme has been referred to as _COX-3_. The antipyretic actions of acetaminophen are likely attributed to direct action on heat-regulating centers in the brain, resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating, and loss of body heat [F4133]. The exact mechanism of action of this drug is not fully understood at this time, but future research may contribute to deeper knowledge [F4133].","Acetaminophen is the major metabolite of _phenacetin_ and _acetanilid_ [F4124]. Acetaminophen is mainly metabolized in the liver by first-order kinetics and its metabolism of comprised of 3 pathways: conjugation with glucuronide, conjugation with sulfate, and oxidation through the cytochrome P450 enzyme pathway, mainly CYP2E1, to produce a reactive metabolite (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine or NAPQI). At normal therapeutic doses, NAPQI undergoes fast conjugation with glutathione and is subsequently metabolized to produce both cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates [FDA label].

High doses of acetaminophen (overdoses) can lead to hepatic necrosis due to the depletion of glutathione and of binding of high levels of reactive metabolite (NAPQI) to important parts of liver cells. The abovementioned damage to the liver can be prevented by the early administration of sulfhydryl compounds, for example, methionine and N-acetylcysteine [A35814].","Acetaminophen has 88% oral bioavailability and reaches its highest plasma concentration 90 minutes after ingestion [A35815].
Peak blood levels of free acetaminophen are not reached until 3 hours after rectal administration of the suppository form of acetaminophen and the peak blood concentration is approximately 50% of the observed concentration after the ingestion of an equivalent oral dose (10-20 mcg/mL) [F4124].

The percentage of a systemically absorbed rectal dose of acetaminophen is inconsistent, demonstrated by major differences in the bioavailability of acetaminophen after a dose administered rectally. Higher rectal doses or an increased frequency of administration may be used to attain blood concentrations of acetaminophen similar to those attained after oral acetaminophen administration [FDA label].","The half-life for adults is 2.5 h after an intravenous dose of 15 mg/kg [FDA label].   After an overdose, the half-life can range from 4 to 8 hours depending on the severity of injury to the liver, as it heavily metabolizes acetaminophen [A35815].  More information on half-life for neonates and other populations may be found on the acetaminophen FDA label [FDA label].","The binding of acetaminophen to plasma proteins is low (ranging from 10% to 25%), when given at therapeutic doses [FDA label].","Acetaminophen metabolites are mainly excreted in the urine. Less than 5% is excreted in the urine as free (unconjugated) acetaminophen and at least 90% of the administered dose is excreted within 24 hours [F4124].","Volume of distribution is about 0.9L/kg. 10 to 20% of the drug is bound to red blood cells [A176357].

**Overdose and liver toxicity** 

Acetaminophen overdose may be manifested by renal tubular necrosis, hypoglycemic coma, and thrombocytopenia.  Sometimes, liver necrosis can occur as well as liver failure. Death and the requirement of a liver transplant may also occur [FDA label]. Metabolism by the CYP2E1 pathway releases a toxic acetaminophen metabolite known as _N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine_(NAPQI). The toxic effects caused by this drug are attributed to NAPQI, not acetaminophen alone [F4133].

**Carcinogenesis**

Long-term studies in mice and rats have been completed by the National Toxicology Program to study the carcinogenic risk of acetaminophen. In 2-year feeding studies, F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice consumed a diet containing acetaminophen up to 6,000 ppm. Female rats showed evidence of carcinogenic activity demonstrated by a higher incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia at doses 0.8 times the maximum human daily dose (MHDD). No evidence of carcinogenesis in male rats (0.7 times) or mice (1.2 to 1.4 times the MHDD) was noted [FDA label]. The clinical relevance of this finding in humans is unknown.

**Mutagenesis**

Acetaminophen was not found to be mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test). Despite this finding, acetaminophen tested positive in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay as well as the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay using human lymphocytes. In published studies, acetaminophen has been reported to be clastogenic (disrupting chromosomes) when given a high dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day to the rat model (3.6 times the MHDD). No clastogenicity was observed at a dose of 750 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the MHDD), indicating that this drug has a threshold before it may cause mutagenesis [FDA label].  The clinical relevance of this finding in humans is unknown.

**Impairment of Fertility**

In studies conducted by the National Toxicology Program, fertility assessments have been performed in Swiss mice in a continuous breeding study. No effects on fertility were seen [FDA label]. 

**Use in pregnancy and nursing**

The FDA label for acetaminophen considers it a pregnancy category C drug, meaning this drug has demonstrated adverse effects in animal studies. No human clinical studies in pregnancy have been done to this date for intravenous acetaminophen [FDA label]. Use acetaminophen only when necessary during pregnancy [FDA label]. Epidemiological data on oral acetaminophen use in pregnant women demonstrate no increase in the risk of major congenital malformations [FDA label]. While prospective clinical studies examining the results of nursing with acetaminophen use have not been conducted, acetaminophen is found secreted in human milk at low concentrations after oral administration. Data from more than 15 nursing mothers taking acetaminophen was obtained, and the calculated daily dose of acetaminophen that reaches the infant is about 1 to 2% of the maternal dose. Caution should be observed when acetaminophen is taken by a nursing woman [FDA label]."

Codeine, an opioid analgesic, was originally approved in the US in 1950 and is a drug used to decrease pain by increasing the threshold for pain without impairing consciousness or altering other sensory functions. Opiates such as codeine are derived from the poppy plant, _Papaver somniferum_ (Papaveraceae).[A175096]

The solution form is used by itself or combined in a syrup with other drugs and is used as a cough suppressant in adults aged 18 and above [L5521], [L5524].","
**General effects**

Codeine is a weak narcotic pain reliever and cough suppressant that is similar to morphine and hydrocodone. A small amount of ingested codeine is converted to morphine in the body.  Codeine increases tolerance to pain, reducing existing discomfort. In addition to decreasing pain, codeine also causes sedation, drowsiness, and respiratory depression [A175096]. 


**Antitussive activity**

This drug has shown antitussive activity in clinical trials [A175102] and has been effective in cough secondary to tuberculosis and insomnia due to coughing [A175096]. Codeine suppresses the cough reflex through a direct effect on the cough center in the medulla [F3658].

**Effects on intestinal motility**

Codeine may reduce intestinal motility through both a local and possibly central mechanism of action [F3661]. This may possibly lead to constipation [F3658]. The chronic use of opioids, including codeine sulfate, may lead to obstructive bowel disease,  particularly in patients with underlying disorders of intestinal motility [FDA label]. 

**Effects on the central nervous system**

Codeine phosphate is an opioid analgesic with uses similar to those of morphine, but is much less potent as an analgesic.  Its primary site of action is at the _mu_ opioid receptors distributed throughout the central nervous system.   The sedative activities of codeine are less potent than those of morphine [F3658].  Codeine may cause respiratory system depression by the activation of µ-opioid receptors at specific sites in the central nervous system [A175108].

**Effects on blood pressure**

This drug poses an increased risk of compromised ability to maintain blood pressure due to peripheral vasodilation and other mechanisms [FDA label]. 


**Effects on chronic cancer pain and other types of pain**

Codeine is an opioid analgesic with similar indications to those of morphine, however, is much less potent in its pain alleviating properties. Its primary action takes place at the mu opioid receptors, which are distributed throughout the central nervous system.  The average duration of action is about 4 hours [F3658].

Regular dosing of opioid analgesics such as codeine in patients with severe cancer pain has been well documented to improve symptoms [A175096], [A175105].","Codeine is a selective agonist for the mu opioid receptor, but with a much weaker affinity to this receptor than morphine, a more potent opioid drug. Codeine binds to mu-opioid receptors, which are involved in the transmission of pain throughout the body and central nervous system [FDA label], [A175096]. The analgesic properties of codeine are thought to arise from its conversion to [Morphine], although the exact mechanism of analgesic action is unknown at this time [FDA label], [F3658].","Approximately 70 to 80% of the ingested dose of codeine is metabolized in the liver by conjugation with glucuronic acid to _codeine-6­ glucuronide_ (C6G) and by O-demethylation to _morphine_ (about 5-10%) and N-demethylation to _norcodeine_ (about 10%) respectively. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 and 2B4 are the major metabolic enzymes mediating the glucurodination of codeine to the metabolite, _codeine 6 glucuronide_. 

Cytochrome P450 2D6 is the major enzyme responsible for the transformation of codeine to morphine and P450 3A4 is the main enzyme mediating the conversion of codeine to _norcodeine_. Morphine and norcodeine are then further metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid. The glucuronide metabolites of morphine are _morphine-3-glucuronide_ (M3G) and_ morphine-6-glucuronide _(M6G). Morphine and M6G have been proven to have analgesic activity in humans. The analgesic activity of C6G in humans is not known at this time.  Norcodeine and M3G are generally not considered to have analgesic properties [FDA label].","**Absorption**

Codeine is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The maximum plasma concentration occurs 60 minutes after administration [FDA label]. 

**Food Effects**

When 60 mg codeine sulfate was given 30 minutes post-ingestion of a high high-calorie meal, there was no significant change in the absorption of codeine [FDA label].

**Steady-state concentration**

The administration of 15 mg codeine sulfate every 4 hours for 5 days lead to steady-state concentrations of codeine, morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) within 48 hours [FDA label]. 
","Plasma half-lives of codeine and its metabolites have been reported to be approximately 3 hours [FDA label].","7-25% bound to plasma proteins [FDA label].","About 90% of the total dose of codeine is excreted by the kidneys. Approximately 10% of the drug excreted by the kidneys is unchanged codeine [FDA label].

Off-label uses: irritable bowel syndrome, sleep disorders, diabetic neuropathy, agitation, fibromyalgia, and insomnia","**Effects in pain and depression**

Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant and an analgesic. It has anticholinergic and sedative properties [FDA label]. 
Clinical studies have shown that oral amitriptyline achieves, at a minimum, good to moderate response in up to 2/3 of patients diagnosed with post-herpetic neuralgia and 3/4 of patients diagnosed with diabetic neuropathic pain, and neurogenic pain syndromes that are frequently unresponsive to narcotic analgesics. Amitriptyline has also shown efficacy in diverse groups of patients with chronic non-malignant pain. There have also been some studies showing efficacy in managing fibromyalgia (an off-label use of this drug) [A174658], [A174667].

**Cardiovascular and Anticholinergic Effects**

Amitriptyline has strong anticholinergic properties and may cause ECG changes and quinidine-like effects on the heart [F3454]. Amitriptyline may inhibit ion channels, which are necessary for cardiac repolarization (hERG channels), in the upper micromolar range of therapeutic plasma concentrations. Therefore, amitriptyline may increase the risk for cardiac arrhythmia [FDA label]. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can be a problem in elderly patients receiving this drug at normal doses for depression. There is evidence in the literature that these effects may occur, rarely, at the lower dosages utilized in the treatment of pain. As with any other tricyclic antidepressant agent, increased glucose levels can occur with amitriptyline [A174661]. 

**Effects on seizure threshold**

This drug also decreases the convulsive threshold and causes alterations in EEG and sleep patterns [F3454].","The mechanism of action of this drug is not fully elucidated. It is suggested that amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for the re-uptake of transmitter amines, such as norepinephrine and serotonin, thereby increasing their concentration at the synaptic clefts of the brain [FDA label], [A174673].   These amines are important in regulating mood.  The monoamine hypothesis in depression, one of the oldest hypotheses, postulates that deficiencies of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the brain lead to depressive effects [A174670].   This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms.

Whether its analgesic effects are related to its mood-altering activities or attributable to a different, less obvious pharmacological action (or a combination of both) is unknown [A174661].","In vitro, the metabolism of amitriptyline occurs mainly by demethylation (CYP2C19, CYP3A4) as well as hydroxylation (CYP2D6) followed by conjugation with glucuronic acid. Other isozymes involved in amitriptyline metabolism are CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. The metabolism of this drug is subject to genetic polymorphisms. The main active metabolite is the secondary amine, _nortriptyline_ [FDA label].

Nortriptyline is a stronger inhibitor of noradrenaline than of serotonin uptake, while amitriptyline inhibits the uptake of noradrenaline and serotonin with equal efficacy. Other metabolites such as _cis-_ and _trans-10-hydroxyamitriptyline_ and _cis-_ and _trans-10-hydroxynortriptyline_ have the same pharmacologic profile as nortriptyline but are significantly weaker. _Demethylnortriptyline_ and amitriptyline N oxide are only present in plasma in negligible amounts; the latter is mostly inactive [FDA label].","Rapidly absorbed following oral administration (bioavailability is 30-60% due to first pass metabolism). Peak plasma concentrations are reached 2-12 hours after oral or intramuscular administration [FDA label].  Steady-state plasma concentrations vary greatly and this variation may be due to genetic differences [F3454].","The elimination half-life (t1/2 ß) amitriptyline after peroral administration is about 25 hours (24.65 ± 6.31 hours; range 16.49-40.36 hours) [FDA Label].","Very highly protein bound (95%) in plasma and tissues [FDA Label].","Amitriptyline and its metabolites are mainly excreted in the urine. Virtually the entire dose is excreted as glucuronide or sulfate conjugate of metabolites, with approximately 2% of unchanged drug appearing in the urine [FDA Label]. 25-50% of a single orally administered dose is excreted in urine as inactive metabolites within 24 hours [FDA label].

Amitriptyline and its metabolites are excreted into breast milk (corresponding to 0.6 % - 1 % of the maternal dose). A risk to the suckling child must be considered. A decision should be made as to whether it is appropriate to discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue/abstain from the therapy of this medicinal product, considering the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

**Effects on fertility**

Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity. No data on the effects of amitriptyline on human fertility are available [FDA label].


**Mutagenesis and carcinogenesis**

The genotoxic potential of amitriptyline has been investigated in various in vitro and in vivo studies. Although these investigations showed
some contradictory results, a potential of amitriptyline to lead to chromosome abnormalities cannot be excluded. Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been performed to this date [FDA label]."

This drug is generally reserved for patients with parkinsonian syndrome receiving levodopa/carbidopa who are experiencing symptom fluctuations and are not responding adequately to or are not candidates for other adjunctive therapies.","Tolcapone is a potent, selective, and reversible inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). In humans, COMT is distributed throughout various organs. COMT catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the phenolic group of substrates that contain a catechol structure. Physiological substrates of COMT include dopa, catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine) and their hydroxylated metabolites. The function of COMT is the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites. COMT is responsible for the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites. In the presence of a decarboxylase inhibitor, COMT becomes the major metabolizing enzyme for levodopa catalyzing it to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine (3-OMD) in the brain and periphery. When tolcapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone. It is believed that these sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease in patients as well as increased levodopa adverse effects, sometimes requiring a decrease in the dose of levodopa.","The precise mechanism of action of tolcapone is unknown, but it is believed to be related to its ability to inhibit COMT and alter the plasma pharmacokinetics of levodopa, resulting in an increase in plasma levodopa concentrations. The inhibition of COMT also causes a reduction in circulating 3-OMD as a result of decreased peripheral metabolism of levodopa. This may lead to an increase distribution of levodopa into the CNS through the reduction of its competitive substrate, 3-OMD, for transport mechanisms. Sustained levodopa concentrations presumably result in more consistent dopaminergic stimulation, resulting in greater reduction in the manifestations of parkinsonian syndrome.","The main metabolic pathway of tolcapone is glucuronidation","Rapidly absorbed (absolute bioavailability is about 65%)","2-3.5 hours","> 99.9% (to serum albumin)","Tolcapone is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, with only a very small amount (0.5% of dose) found unchanged in urine.

Some of the observed effects of the consumption of hydromorphone for acute pain are complete and longlasting pain relief when compared to other pain relief agents such as [meperidine], [morphine], [diamorphine], [bupivacaine], [indomethacin], and [fentanyl]. On the same trials, hydromorphone was shown to produce respiratory depression, lower cognitive function, miosis, mydriasis, constipation, hypotension, and vertigo but to present a reduced incidence of pruritus (which indicates a lower release of histamine) and nausea.[A176507]

The respiratory depression is known to be caused by the effect on the brain stem respiratory centers as well as to a reduction in the responsiveness of this brain stems to increase carbon dioxide tension.[L5798]","Hydromorphone is an opioid agonist that can bind to different types of opioid receptors. Its analgesic effect is suggested to be related to the effect on the mu-opioid receptors.

NSAIDs consist of agents that are structurally unrelated; the NSAID chemical classification of indometacin is an indole-acetic acid derivative with the chemical name 1- (p-chlorobenzoyl)25-methoxy-2-methylindole-3-acetic acid.[A177871] The pharmacological effect of indometacin is not fully understood, however, it is thought to be mediated through potent and nonselective inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is the main enzyme responsible for catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis via the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway. Indometacin was first discovered in 1963 and it was first approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965, [A486] along with other acetic acid derivatives such as [diclofenac] and [sulindac] that were also developed during the 1960s.[A177871] Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as “indomethacin-responsive” headache disorders.[A177871] 

Most commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, acute shoulder pains, and acute gouty arthritis, indometacin is currently available as oral capsules as well as other methods of administration, including rectal and intravenous formulations. Intravenous indometacin is administered to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, as indicated by clinical evidence, in premature infants.[F4600] Ophthalmic indometacin has been studied and used in the symptomatic treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation and pain and/or complications after cataract surgery. Although deemed effective in reducing ocular inflammation in clinical studies, topical NSAIDs were also associated with a potential reduction in corneal sensitivity accompanied by an increased risk of superficial punctate keratitis and subjective symptoms of discomfort, including pain, burning or pricking, or a tingling sensation after instillation into the cul-de-sac.[A177949]","53-86-1","XXE1CET956",357.788,357.076785712,"solid",2,10,0,1,"Hubertus L.

Intravenous indometacin is indicated to induce closure of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants weighing between 500 and 1750 g when after 48 hours usual medical management (e.g., fluid restriction, diuretics, digitalis, respiratory support, etc.) is ineffective.[F4600]","Indometacin is an NSAID with analgesic and antipyretic properties that exerts its pharmacological effects by inhibiting the synthesis of factors involved in pain, fever, and inflammation. Its therapeutic action does not involve pituitary-adrenal stimulation.[L6778] Indometacin primarily works by suppressing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis by providing relief of pain as well as reducing fever, swelling, and tenderness. This effectiveness has been demonstrated by a reduction in the extent of joint swelling, the average number of joints displaying symptoms of inflammation, and the severity of morning stiffness. Increased mobility was demonstrated by a decrease in total walking time and by improved functional capability seen as an increase in grip strength.[L6778] In clinical trials, indometacin was shown to be effective in relieving the pain, reducing the fever, swelling, redness, and tenderness of acute gouty arthritis. Due to its pharmacological actions, the use of indometacin is associated with the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as gastrointestinal effects such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines.[L6778]

In a study of healthy individuals, acute oral and intravenous indometacin therapy resulted in a transiently diminished basal and CO2 stimulated cerebral blood flow; this effect disappeared in one study after one week of oral treatment.[L6778] The clinical significance of this effect has not been established. Compared to other NSAIDs, it is suggested that indometacin is a more potent vasoconstrictor that is more consistent in decreasing cerebral blood flow and inhibiting CO2 reactivity.[A177871] There have been studies that show indometacin directly inhibiting neuronal activity to some extent in the trigeminocervical complex after either superior salivatory nucleus or dural stimulation.[A177871]","Indometacin is a nonspecific and reversible inhibitor of the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme, or prostaglandin G/H synthase. There are two identified isoforms of COX: COX-1 is universally present in most body tissues and is involved in the synthesis of the prostaglandins and thromboxane A2, while COX-2 is expressed in response to injury or inflammation.[A177871] Constitutively expressed, the COX-1 enzyme is involved in gastric mucosal protection, platelet, and kidney function by catalyzing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) G2 and PGG2 to PGH2.[A177871] COX-2 is constitutively expressed and highly inducible by inflammatory stimuli. It is found in the central nervous system, kidneys, uterus, and other organs. COX-2 also catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG2 and PGG2 to PGH2. In the COX-2-mediated pathway, PGH2 is further converted to PGE2 and PGI2 (also known as prostacyclin). PGE2 is involved in mediating inflammation, pain, and fever. Decreasing levels of PGE2 leads to reduced inflammatory reactions. Indometacin is known to inhibit both isoforms of COX, however, with greater selectivity for COX-1, which accounts for its increased adverse gastric effects relative to other NSAIDs. It binds to the active site of the enzyme and prevents the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate, arachidonic acid. Indometacin, unlike other NSAIDs, also inhibits phospholipase A2, the enzyme responsible for releasing arachidonic acid from phospholipids. The analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of indomethacin as well as adverse reactions associated with the drug occur as a result of decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Its antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation.

The exact mechanism of action of indometacin in inducing closure of a patent ductus arteriosus is not fully understood; however, it is thought to be through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.[L6778] At birth, the ductus arteriosus is normally closed as the tension of the oxygen increases significantly after birth.[A177880] Patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants is associated with congenital heart malformations where PGE1 mediates an opposite effect to that of oxygen. PGE1 dilates the ductus arteriosus through smooth muscle relaxation and prevents the closure of the ductus arteriosus.[A177880] By inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, indometacin promotes the closure of ductus arteriosus.[F4600]","Indometacin undergoes hepatic metabolism involving glucuronidation, O-desmethylation, and N-deacylation.[A177949] O-desmethyl-indomethacin, N-deschlorobenzoyl-indomethacin, and O-desmethyl-N-deschlorobenzoyl-indomethacin metabolites and their glucuronides are primarily inactive and have no pharmacological activity.[A177949,L6778] Unconjugated metabolites are also detected in the plasma.[L6778] Its high bioavailability indicates that indometacin is unlikely to be subject to the first-pass metabolism.[A177949]","Indometacin displays a linear pharmacokinetics profile where the plasma concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) are dose-proportional, whereas half-life (T1/2) and plasma and renal clearance are dose-dependent.[A177871] Indometacin is readily and rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The bioavailability is virtually 100% following oral administration [A177871] and about 90% of the dose is absorbed within 4 hours.[L6778] The bioavailability is about 80-90% following rectal administration.[A177901]

The mean half-life of oral indomethacin is estimated to be about 4.5 hours.[L6778] The disposition of intravenous indometacin in preterm neonates was shown to vary across premature infants. In neonates older than 7 days, the mean plasma half-life of intravenous indometacin was approximately 20 hours, ranging from 15 hours in infants weighing more than 1000 g and 21 hours in infants weighing less than 1000 g.[F4600]","Indometacin is a weak organic acid that is 90-99% bound to protein in plasma over the expected range of therapeutic plasma concentrations [A177949,L6778].

Currently, metformin is the first drug of choice for the management of type II diabetes and is prescribed to at least 120 million people worldwide [A176173]. 

Metformin is considered an antihyperglycemic drug because it lowers blood glucose concentrations in type II diabetes without causing hypoglycemia. Metformin is commonly described as an _insulin sensitizer_ leading to a decrease in insulin resistance and a clinically significant reduction of plasma fasting insulin levels [A176173]. Another well-known benefit of this drug is modest weight loss. Metformin is the drug of choice for obese type II diabetes patients [A36559].

The extended-release form is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in only _adults_ with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Safety in children has not been determined to this date [FDA label].","**General effects**

Insulin is an important hormone that regulates blood glucose levels [T514]. Type II diabetes is characterized by a decrease in sensitivity to insulin, resulting in eventual elevations in blood glucose when the pancreas can no longer compensate. In patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, insulin no longer exerts adequate effects on tissues and cells (called insulin resistance) [T514] and insulin deficiency may also be present [L5753].

Metformin reduces liver (hepatic) production of glucose, decreases the intestinal absorption of glucose, and enhances insulin sensitivity by increasing both peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. In contrast with drugs of the _sulfonylurea_ class, which lead to hyperinsulinemia, the secretion of insulin is unchanged with metformin use [FDA label].

**Effect on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)**

HbA1c is an important periodic measure of glycemic control that is used to monitor diabetic patients. Fasting plasma glucose is also a useful and important measure of glycemic control. In a 29-week clinical trial of subjects diagnosed with type II diabetes, metformin decreased the fasting plasma glucose levels by an average of 59 mg/dL from baseline, compared to an average increase of 6.3 mg/dL from baseline in subjects taking a placebo [FDA label].  Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was decreased by about 1.4% in subjects receiving metformin, and increased by 0.4% in subjects receiving placebo only [FDA label].","
Metformin's mechanisms of action are unique from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic drugs. Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production (gluconeogenesis), decreasing the intestinal absorption of glucose, and increasing insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization [FDA label]. It is well established that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, and it has since been generally postulated that its potent antidiabetic effects occur through this mechanism [A36534, A36557].   The above processes lead to a decrease in blood glucose, managing type II diabetes and exerting positive effects on glycemic control.

After ingestion, the organic cation transporter-1 (OCT1) is responsible for the uptake of metformin into hepatocytes (liver cells). As this drug is positively charged, it accumulates in cells and in the mitochondria because of the membrane potentials across the plasma membrane as well as the mitochondrial inner membrane. Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I, preventing the production of mitochondrial ATP leading to increased cytoplasmic ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP ratios [A36534]. These changes activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism [A176348]. Aside from this mechanism, AMPK can be activated by a lysosomal mechanism involving other activators.  Following this process, increases in AMP:ATP ratio also inhibit _fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase_ enzyme, resulting in the inhibition of gluconeogenesis, while also inhibiting _adenylate cyclase_ and decreasing the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) [A36534], a derivative of ATP used for cell signaling [A176351]. Activated AMPK phosphorylates two isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme, thereby inhibiting fat synthesis and leading to fat oxidation, reducing hepatic lipid stores and increasing liver sensitivity to insulin [A36534].  

In the intestines, metformin increases anaerobic glucose metabolism in enterocytes (intestinal cells), leading to reduced net glucose uptake and increased delivery of lactate to the liver. Recent studies have also implicated the gut as a primary site of action of metformin and suggest that the liver may not be as important for metformin action in patients with type 2 diabetes. Some of the ways metformin may play a role on the intestines is by promoting the metabolism of glucose by increasing glucagon-like peptide I (GLP-1) as well as increasing gut utilization of glucose  [A36534]. 

In addition to the above pathway, the mechanism of action of metformin may be explained by other ways, and its exact mechanism of action has been under extensive study in recent years [A36535, A36554, A36555, A36557].","Intravenous studies using a single dose of metformin in normal subjects show that metformin is excreted as unchanged drug in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) or biliary excretion [FDA label].","
**Regular tablet absorption**

The absolute bioavailability of a metformin 500 mg tablet administered in the fasting state is about 50%-60%. Single-dose clinical studies using oral doses of metformin 500 to 1500 mg and 850 to 2550 mg show that there is a lack of dose proportionality with an increase in metformin dose, attributed to decreased absorption rather than changes in elimination [FDA label]. 

At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are achieved within 24-48 hours and are normally measured at <1 µg/mL [FDA label].

**Extended-release tablet absorption**

After a single oral dose of metformin extended-release, Cmax is reached with a median value of 7 hours and a range of between 4 and 8 hours. Peak plasma levels are measured to be about 20% lower compared to the same dose of regular metformin, however, the extent of absorption of both forms (as measured by area under the curve - AUC), are similar [FDA label].

**Effect of food**

Food reduces the absorption of metformin, as demonstrated by about a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute increase in time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) after ingestion of an 850 mg tablet of metformin taken with food, compared to the same dose administered during fasting [FDA label].

Though the extent of metformin absorption (measured by the area under the curve - AUC) from the metformin extended-release tablet is increased by about 50% when given with food, no effect of food on Cmax and Tmax of metformin is observed. High and low-fat meals exert similar effects on the pharmacokinetics of extended-release metformin [FDA label].","Approximately 6.2 hours in the plasma [FDA label] and in the blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution [FDA label].","Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins [FDA label], in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound [A176140].","This drug is substantially excreted by the kidney [FDA label]. 

Renal clearance of metformin is about 3.5 times higher than creatinine clearance, which shows that renal tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. After oral administration, about 90% of absorbed metformin is eliminated by the kidneys within the first 24 hours post-ingestion [FDA label].","The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin after one oral dose of metformin 850 mg averaged at 654 ± 358 L [FDA label].","Renal clearance is about 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination.

**A note on lactic acidosis**

Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, thereby increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis [FDA label]. There have been reported postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including some fatal cases. Such cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms including malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence. In certain cases, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe lactic acidosis [FDA label]. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), as well as an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL[FDA label].

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment [FDA label].

**A note on renal function**

In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [FDA label].

Metformin should be avoided in those with severely compromised renal function (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), acute/decompensated heart failure, severe liver disease and for 48 hours after the use of iodinated contrast dyes due to the risk of lactic acidosis [FDA label]. Lower doses should be used in the elderly and those with decreased renal function. Metformin decreases fasting plasma glucose, postprandial blood glucose and glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Metformin may also have a positive effect on lipid levels. 

**A note on hypoglycemia**

 When used alone, metformin does not cause hypoglycemia, however, it may potentiate the hypoglycemic effects of sulfonylureas and insulin when they are used together [FDA label].

**Use in pregnancy** 

Available data from post-marketing studies have not indicated a clear association of metformin with major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin was ingested during pregnancy. Despite this, the abovementioned studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any metformin-associated risk due to methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent study groups [FDA label].

**Use in nursing**

A limited number of published studies indicate that metformin is present in human milk. There is insufficient information to confirm the effects of metformin on the nursing infant and no available data on the effects of metformin on the production of milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered as well as the mother’s clinical need for metformin and any possible adverse effects on the nursing child [FDA label]."

In clinical trials where ipratropium was used in the initial management of status asthmaticus, it was demonstrated a clear benefit in pulmonary function in children and adults.

8) Management of alcohol withdrawal.[A178174,A178177]","Atenolol is a cardio-selective beta-blocker and as such exerts most of its effects on the heart.[label] It acts as an antagonist to sympathetic innervation and prevents increases in heart rate, electrical conductivity, and contractility in the heart due to increased release of norepinephrine from the peripheral nervous system.[label,T116,A178258] Together the decreases in contractility and rate produce a reduction in cardiac output resulting in a compensatory increase in peripheral vascular resistance in the short-term. This response later declines to baseline with long-term use of atenolol. More importantly, this reduction in the work demanded of the myocardium also reduces oxygen demand which provides therapeutic benefit by reducing the mismatch of oxygen supply and demand in settings where coronary blood flow is limited, such as in coronary atherosclerosis. Reducing oxygen demand, particularly due to exercise, can reduce the frequency of angina pectoris symptoms and potentially improve survival of the remaining myocardium after myocardial infarction. The decrease in rate of sinoatrial node potentials, electrical conduction, slowing of potentials traveling through the atrioventricular node, and reduced frequency of ectopic potentials due to blockade of adrenergic beta receptors has led to benefit in arrhythmic conditions such as atrial fibrillation by controlling the rate of action potential generation and allowing for more effective coordinated contractions. Since a degree of sympathetic activity is necessary to maintain cardiac function, the reduced contractility induced by atenolol may precipitate or worsen heart failure, especially during volume overload.[label]

The effects of atenolol on blood pressure have been established, although it is less effective than alternative beta-blockers, but the mechanism has not yet been characterized.[label,T116] As a ß1 selective drug, it does not act via the vasodilation produced by non-selective agents.[T116] Despite this there is a sustained reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, and consequently blood pressure, alongside a decrease in cardiac output. It is thought that atenolol's antihypertensive activity may be related to action on the central nervous system (CNS) or it's inhibition of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system rather than direct effects on the vasculature.[label]

Atenolol produces CNS effects similar to other beta-blockers, but does so to a lesser extent due to reduces ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.[T116] It has the potential to produce fatigue, depression, and sleep disturbances such as nightmares or insomnia.[label,T116] The exact mechanisms behind these have not been characterized but their occurrence must be considered as they represent clinically relevant adverse effects.

Atenolol exerts some effects on the respiratory system although to a much lesser extent than non-selective beta-blockers.[label] Interaction with ß2 receptors in the airways can produce bronchoconstriction by blocking the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle mediated by the sympathetic nervous system.[T116] The same action can interfere with ß-agonist therapies used in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.[label,A178258,T116]

Unlike some other beta-blocker drugs, atenolol does not have intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity nor does it produce changes in glycemic control.[label]","Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker, called such because it selectively binds to the ß1-adrenergic receptor as an antagonist up to a reported 26 fold more than ß2 receptors.[A178372] Selective activity at the ß1 receptor produces cardioselectivity due to the higher population of this receptor in cardiac tissue. Some binding to ß2 and possibly ß3 receptors can still occur at therapeutic dosages but the effects mediated by antagonizing these are significantly reduced from those of non-selective agents. ß1 and ß2 receptors are G<sub>s</sub> coupled therefore antagonism of their activation reduces activity of adenylyl cyclase and its downstream signalling via cyclic adenosime monophosphate and protein kinase A (PKA). 

In cardiomyocytes PKA is thought to mediate activation of L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors through their phosphorylation.[A178396] L-type calcium channels can then provide an initial rise in intracellular calcium and trigger the ryanodine receptors to release calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and increased contractility. PKA also plays a role in the cessation of contraction by phosphorylating phospholamban which in turn increases the affinity of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase to increase reuptake of calcium into the SR. It also phophorylates troponin I to reduce affinity of the protein for calcium. Both of these events lead to a reduction in contraction which, when coupled with the initial increase in contraction, allows for faster cycling and consequently higher heart rate with increased contractility. L-type calcium channels are also a major contributor to cardiac depolarization and their activation can increase frequency of action potentials and possibly the incidence of ectopic potentials.[A178405] 

Similar inihibitory events occur in the bronchial smooth muscle to mediate relaxation including phosphorylation of myosin light-chain kinase, reducing its affinity for calcium.[A178408] PKA also inhibits the excitatory G<sub>q</sub> coupled pathway by phosphorylating the inositol trisphosphate receptor and phospholipase C resulting in inhibition of intracellular calcium release. Antagonism of this activity by beta-blocker agents like atenolol can thus cause increased bronchoconstriction.

Scientists do not know exactly how pimecrolimus reduces the manifestations of atopic dermatitis, but pimecrolimus reduces the action of T-cells and mast cells which are part of the immune system and contribute to responses of the immune system.

• Pathologic hypersecretory conditions in adults","**Effects on gastric acid secretion**

This drug decreases gastric acid secretion [FDA label]. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect of omeprazole is usually achieved within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring by 2 hours after administration. The inhibitory effect of omeprazole on acid secretion increases with repeated once-daily dosing, reaching a plateau after four days [FDA label].

**Effects on serum gastrin**

In studies of 200 or more patients, serum gastrin levels increased during the first 1-2 weeks of daily administration of therapeutic doses of omeprazole. This occurred in a parallel fashion with the inhibition of acid secretion. No further increase in serum gastrin occurred with continued omeprazole administration. Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum Chromogranin A (CgA) levels. The increased CgA levels may lead to false positive results in diagnostic studies for neuroendocrine tumors [FDA label].

**Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell effects**

Human gastric biopsy samples have been obtained from more than 3000 pediatric and adult patients treated with omeprazole in long-term clinical studies. The incidence of enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia in these studies increased with time; however, no case of ECL cell carcinoids, dysplasia, or neoplasia have been identified in these patients. These studies, however, are of insufficient in power and duration to draw conclusions on the possible influence of long-term administration of omeprazole in the development of any premalignant or malignant conditions [FDA label]. 

**Other effects**

Systemic effects of omeprazole in the central nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory systems have not been found to date. Omeprazole, given in oral doses of 30 or 40 mg for 2-4 weeks, showed no effect on thyroid function, carbohydrate metabolism, or circulating levels of parathyroid hormone, cortisol, estradiol, testosterone, prolactin, cholecystokinin or secretin [FDA label]. 


","Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump [A175180], expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach. ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid) [A174295].

Omeprazole is a member of a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted _benzimidazoles_, that stop gastric acid secretion by selective inhibition of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ enzyme system. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole bind covalently to cysteine residues via disulfide bridges on the alpha subunit of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ pump, inhibiting gastric acid secretion for up to 36 hours [A175192].  This antisecretory effect is dose-related and leads to the inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion, regardless of the stimulus [FDA label].  

**Mechanism of H. pylori eradication**

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is frequently associated with _Helicobacter pylori_ bacterial infection (NSAIDs) [A175195]. The treatment of H. pylori infection may include the addition of omeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors as part of the treatment regimen [FDA label], [A175198]. 
_H. pylori_ replicates most effectively at a neutral pH [A175213]. Acid inhibition in H. pylori eradication therapy, including proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, raises gastric pH, discouraging the growth of H.pylori [A175198]. It is generally believed that proton pump inhibitors inhibit the _urease_ enzyme, which increases the pathogenesis of H. pylori in gastric-acid related conditions [A175216].","Omeprazole is heavily metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The main part of its metabolism depends on the polymorphically expressed CYP2C19, which is responsible for the formation of _hydroxyomeprazole_, the major metabolite found in plasma. The remaining part depends on CYP3A4, responsible for the formation of _omeprazole sulphone_ [FDA label].","Omeprazole delayed-release capsules contain an enteric-coated granule formulation of omeprazole (because omeprazole is acid-labile), so that absorption of omeprazole begins only after the granules exit the stomach [FDA label]. 

Absorption of omeprazole occurs rapidly, with peak plasma concentrations of omeprazole achieved within 0.5-3.5 hours [FDA label]. 

Absolute bioavailability (compared with intravenous administration) is approximately 30-40% at doses of 20-40 mg, largely due to pre-systemic metabolism. The bioavailability of omeprazole increases slightly upon repeated administration of omeprazole delayed-release capsules [FDA label].","0.5-1 hour (healthy subjects, delayed-release capsule) [FDA label]

Limited data indicate that omeprazole may be present in human milk. There is currently no information on the effects of omeprazole on the breastfed infant or production of milk.  The benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the level of need for omeprazole and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from omeprazole [FDA label].

It is used with other drugs to treat tuberculosis. It is a highly specific agent and is active only against <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. In vitro and in vivo, the drug is active only at a slightly acid pH. Pyrazinamie gets activated to Pyrazinoic acid in the bacilli where it interferes with fatty acid synthase FAS I. This interferes with the bacteriums ability to synthesize new fatty acids, required for growth and replication.","Pyrazinamide diffuses into active _M. tuberculosis_ that express pyrazinamidase enzyme that converts pyrazinamide to the active form pyrazinoic acid. Pyrazinoic acid can leak out under acidic conditions to be converted to the protonated conjugate acid, which is readily diffused back into the bacilli and accumulate intracellularly. The net effect is that more pyrazinoic acid accumulates inside the bacillus at acid pH than at neutral pH. Pyrazinoic acid was thought to inhibit the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) I, which is required by the bacterium to synthesise fatty acids. However, this theory was thought to have been discounted (PMID: 11914348). However, further studies reproduced the results of FAS I inhibition as the putative mechanism first in whole cell assay of replicating M. tuberculosis bacilli which have shown that pyrazinoic acid and its ester inhibit the synthesis of fatty acids (PMID: 17101678). This study was followed by in vitro assay of tuberculous FAS I enzyme that tested the activity with pyrazinamide, pyrazinoic acid and several classes of pyrazinamide analogs. Pyrazinamide and its analogs inhibited the activity of purified FAS I (PMID: 17485499). 

It has also been suggested that the accumulation of pyrazinoic acid disrupts membrane potential and interferes with energy production, necessary for survival of M. tuberculosis at an acidic site of infection. Pyrazinoic acid has also been shown to bind to the ribosomal protein S1 (RpsA) and inhibit trans-translation. This may explain the ability of the drug to kill dormant mycobacteria (PMID: 21835980).","Hepatic.","Rapidly and well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.","9-10 hours (normal conditions)","~10% (bound to plasma proteins)","Approximately 70% of an oral dose is excreted in the urine, mainly by glomerular filtration within 24 hours",NA,NA,"PiraldinaBraccoPrazinaArmoxindoPyrafatRiemserPyrazideSanofi-AventisTebrazidValeantTisamidOrion",3,NA,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00339.pdf?1265922734",1,1139,"Side effects include liver injury, arthralgias, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, dysuria,malaise and fever, sideroblastic anemia, adverse effects on the blood clotting mechanism or vascular integrity, and hypersensitivity reactions such as urticaria, pruritis and skin rashes."

One of the most common uses for this drug is for a condition called _allergic rhinitis_. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis in the United States is about 15% according to physician diagnoses, and up to 30%, according to self-reported nasal symptoms. Allergic rhinitis is associated with multiple missed or unproductive days at work and school, problems with sleep, and other difficulties with day to day activities for many individuals [A175057].

**Effects on urticaria/anti-inflammatory effects**

It has anti-inflammatory properties that may play a role in asthma management [A175051]. There is evidence that cetirizine improves symptoms of urticaria. Marked clinical inhibition of a wheal and flare response occurs in infants, children as well as adults within 20 minutes of one oral dose and lasts for 24 h [A175051].  Concomitant use of cetirizine reduces the duration and dose of topical anti-inflammatory formulas used for the treatment of atopic dermatitis [A175051].","Cetirizine, a metabolite of _hydroxyzine_, is an antihistamine drug.  Its main effects are achieved through selective inhibition of peripheral H1 receptors. The antihistamine activity of cetirizine has been shown in a variety of animal and human models. _In vivo_ and _ex vivo_ animal models have shown insignificant anticholinergic and antiserotonergic effects. In clinical studies, however, dry mouth was found to be more frequent with cetirizine than with a placebo. In vitro receptor binding studies have demonstrated no detectable affinity of cetirizine for histamine receptors  other than the H1 receptors. Studies with radiolabeled cetirizine administration in the rat have demonstrated insignificant penetration into the brain. _Ex vivo_ studies in the mouse have shown that systemically administered cetirizine does not occupy cerebral H1 receptors significantly [FDA label].","A mass balance clinical trial comprised of 6 healthy male study volunteers showed that 70% of the administered radioactivity was measured in the urine and 10% in the feces after cetirizine administration. About 50% of the radioactivity was measured in the urine as unchanged cetirizine. Most of the rapid increase in peak plasma radioactivity was related to the parent drug, implying a low level of first pass metabolism. This prevents potential interactions of cetirizine with drugs interacting with hepatic cytochrome enzymes [A175051]. 

Cetirizine is metabolized partially by oxidative O-dealkylation to a metabolite with insignificant antihistaminic activity.

Apart from its main FDA-approved indications, diltiazem has also been used for numerous off-label indications, such as anal fissures (in topical formulations), migraine prophylaxis, pulmonary hypertension, and rest-related cramps in the lower extremities.[L6289] Typically available in extended-release oral and intravenous formulations, diltiazem is marketed under various brand names with Cardizem and Tiazac being the most common ones.","42399-41-7","EE92BBP03H",414.518,414.16132802,"solid",2,6,1,3,"Kugita, H., Inoue, H., Ikezaki, M. and Takeo, S.; U.S. Patent 3,562,257; assigned to Tanabe Seiyaku Co.,Ltd., Japan.","**Oral**

This is related to the long-term therapeutic effects, as lowering the blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.[label] Diltiazem inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium ions across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes during depolarization. Diltiazem is classified as a negative inotrope (decreased force) and negative chronotrope (decreased rate).[L6289] It is also considered a rate-control drug as it reduces heart rate.[A178432,T28] Diltiazem is exerts hemodynamic actions by reducing blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, the rate-pressure product, and coronary vascular resistance while increasing coronary blood flow.[L6292] Diltiazem decreases sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction in isolated tissues and has a negative inotropic effect in isolated preparations.[label] In supraventricular tachycardia, diltiazem prolongs AV nodal refractories.[L6292]

As the magnitude of blood pressure reduction is related to the degree of hypertension, the antihypertensive effect of diltiazem is most pronounced in individuals with hypertension.[label] In a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-response study involving patients with essential hypertension, there was a reduction in the diastolic blood pressure by 1.9, 5.4, 6.1, and 8.6 mmHg in the patients receiving diltiazem at doses of 120, 240, 360, and 540 mg, respectively. In patients receiving placebo, there was a reduction in the diastolic blood pressure by 2.6 mmHg.[label] In a randomized, double-blind study involving patients with chronic stable angina, variable doses of diltiazem administered at night all caused an increased exercise tolerance in the after 21 hours, compared to placebo.[label] In the NORDIL study of patients with hypertension, the therapeutic effectiveness of diltiazem in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was assessed.[A178432] When using the combined primary endpoint as fatal and non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular death, fatal and non-fatal stroke was shown to be reduced by 25% in the diltiazem group. Although the clinical significance to this effect remains unclear, it is suggested that diltiazem may exert a protective role against cerebral stroke in hypertensive patients.[A178432]","Excitation of cardiac muscle involves the activation of a slow calcium inward current that is induced by L-type slow calcium channels, which are voltage-sensitive, ion-selective channels[A178444] associated with a high activation threshold and slow inactivation profile.[T28] L-type calcium channels are the main current responsible for the late phase of the pacemaker potential.[A178492] Acting as the main Ca2+ source for contraction in smooth and cardiac muscle, activation of L-type calcium channels allows the influx of calcium ions into the muscles upon depolarization and excitation of the channel.[A178444] It is proposed that this cation influx may also trigger the release of additional calcium ions from intracellular storage sites.[A178444] Diltiazem is a slow calcium channel blocker that binds to the extracellular site of the alpha-1C subunit of the channel, which is thought to be the S5-6 linker region of the transmembrane domain IV and/or S6 segment of domain III.[A178492]  Diltiazem can get access to this binding site from either the intracellular or extracellular side, but it requires a voltage-induced conformational changes in the membrane.[A178492] Diltiazem inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes.[label] In isolated human atrial and ventricular myocardium, diltiazem suppressed tension over the range of membrane potentials associated with calcium channel activity but had little effect on the tension-voltage relations at more positive potentials.[A178453] This effect is thought to be mediated by the voltage-dependent block of the L-type calcium channels and inhibition of calcium ion release from the ER stores, without altering the sodium-calcium coupled transport or calcium sensitivity of myofilaments.[A178453] Through inhibition of inward calcium current, diltiazem exerts a direct ionotropic and energy sparing effect on the myocardium.[A178444] Diltiazem fslows atrioventricular nodal conduction, which is due to its ability to impede slow channel function.[A178444]

Reduced intracellular calcium concentrations equate to increased smooth muscle relaxation resulting in arterial vasodilation and therefore, decreased blood pressure.[L6289] The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload.[label,L6289] Through its actions on reducing calcium levels in cardiac and vascular smooth muscles, diltiazem causes a reduction in the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells and vasodilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, including epicardial and subendocardial. This subsequently leads to increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, improved cardiac output due to increased stroke volume, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure and heart rate, and decreased afterload.[label,L6289] Diltiazem lowers myocardial oxygen demand through a reduction in heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility; this leads to a therapeutic effect in improving exercise tolerance in chronic stable angina.[A178432, L6289]","Diltiazem is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism, which explains its relatively low absolute oral bioavailability. It undergoes metabolism primarily mediated by CYP3A4. Diltiazem is reported to undergo deacetylation, N- demethylation, and O-demethylation, as well as conjugation reactions mediated by CYP450 enzymes, with CYP3A4 being the primary enzyme responsible for drug metabolism. Metabolites N-monodesmethyldiltiazem, desacetyldiltiazem, desacetyl-N-monodesmethyldiltiazem, desacetyl-O- desmethyldiltiazem, and desacetyl-N, O-desmethyldiltiazem have been identified in human urine.[L6292] It is proposed that N-desmethyldiltiazem, deacetyldiltiazem, deacetyl-N-monodesmethyldiltiazem, and desacetyl-O- desmethyldiltiazem all retain pharmacological activity with varying potency.[A178516] Desacetyldiltiazem is present in the plasma at levels of 10% to 20% of the parent drug and retains about 25-50% of the pharmacological activity to that of the parent compound.[label] Radioactivity studies indicate the presence of other metabolites that persist in the plasma for 20 hours, compared to diltiazem that is detectable for 2 to 5 hours.[label]","Diltiazem is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Minimum therapeutic plasma diltiazem concentrations appear to be in the range of 50 to 200 ng/mL.[label] Following oral administration of extended formulations of 360 mg diltiazem, the drug in plasma was detectable within 3 to 4 hours and the peak plasma concentrations were reached between 11 and 18 hours post-dose. Diltiazem peak and systemic exposures were not affected by concurrent food intake.[label] Due to hepatic first-pass metabolism, the absolute bioavailability following oral administration is about 40%[label], with the value ranging from 24 to 74% due to high interindividual variation in the first pass effect.[A178420] The bioavailability may increase in patients with hepatic impairment.[label]","The plasma elimination half-life is approximately 3.0 - 4.5 hours following single and multiple oral doses.

A dose of 360 mg/kg resulted in lethality in monkeys. The intravenous LD<sub>50</sub> is 60 mg/kg in mice and 38 mg/kg in rats. 

Cases of overdose from doses ranging from less than 1 g to 18 g have been reported with diltiazem, with several cases involving multiple drug ingestions resulting in death. Overdoses were associated with bradycardia, hypotension, heart block, and cardiac failure that may manifest as dizziness, lightheadedness, and fatigue.[L6289] Actual treatment and dosage should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician. Diltiazem overdose should be responded with appropriate supportive measures and gastrointestinal decontamination. Bradycardia and heart block can be treated with atropine at doses ranging from 0.60 to 1.0 mg. In the case of bradycardia, if there is no response to vagal blockage, cautious administration of isoproterenol should be considered. Cardiac pacing can also be used to treat fixed high-degree AV block. In the case of heart failure, blood pressure may be maintained with the use of fluids and vasopressors, as well as inotropic agents such as [isoproterenol], [dopamine], or [dobutamine]. Other appropriate measures include ventilatory support, gastric lavage, activated charcoal, and/or intravenous calcium. Diltiazem does not appear to be removed by peritoneal or hemodialysis.[label]

**Non-clinical toxicity**

In a 24-month study in rats receiving oral doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity. There was also no mutagenic response _in vitro_ or _in vivo_ in mammalian cell assays or _in vitro_ bacterial assays. No evidence of impaired fertility was observed in a study performed in male and female rats receiving oral doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day.[label]

**Pregnancy and Lactation**

In reproduction studies in animals, administration of diltiazem at doses ranging from five to twenty times the daily recommended human therapeutic dose resulted in cases of the embryo and fetal lethality and skeletal abnormalities, and an increase in the risk of stillbirths. There have been no up-to-date controlled studies that investigated the use of diltiazem in pregnant women. The use of diltiazem in pregnant women should be undertaken only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.[label] Diltiazem is excreted in human milk, where one report suggests that the concentrations in breast milk may approximate serum levels; therefore, the decision should be made to either discontinue nursing or the use of the drug after careful consideration of the clinical necessity of diltiazem therapy in the nursing mother.[label]

**Use in special populations**

As there is limited information on the variable effects of diltiazem in geriatric patients, the initial therapy of diltiazem should involve the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Currently, there are no specific dosing guidelines for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.[label]"

However, it is considered a partial agonist to GABA-A receptors which sets clobazam apart from 1,4-benzodiazepines which are full agonist. The significance of this difference is that one may experience less sedation with clobazam than with other benzodiazepines. Unlike the endogenous GABA ligand, clobazam binds allosterically to the GABA receptor to increase the frequency of the chloride channel opening and membrane permeability to chloride ions.   Pharmacodynamic tolerance has been demonstrated in animal models.","Clobazam binds at distinct binding sites associated with the chloride ionopore at the post-synaptic GABA receptor. These GABA receptors are in various locations in the CNS (limbic, reticular formation) and clobazam increases the duration of time for which the chloride ionopore is open. As a result, hyper polarization and stabilization of the membrane occur as the post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA is enhanced.","Clobazam is extensively metabolized in the liver via N-demethylation and hydroxylation to form two major metabolites, N-desmethylclobazam (norclobazam) and 4'-hydroxyclobazam, respectively. N-desmethylclobazam (norclobazam) retains pharmacological activity. Norclobazam is one-fourth the potency of clobazam. The main enzyme that facilitates the process of N-demethylation is CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and CYP2B6. Norclobazam itself is also metabolized via hydroxylation, primarily by CYP2C19. The formation of 4'-hydroxyclobazam is facilitated by CYP2C18 and CYP2C19. A factor in determining extent of metabolism is the genetic profile of the individual patient as CYP2C19 is a polymorphic enzyme.","After oral administration of clobazam, it is almost completely absorbed (87% of dose).

They prevent these substances becoming incorporated in to DNA during the ""S"" phase (of the cell cycle), stopping normal development and division. Thioguanine was first synthesized and entered into clinical trial more than 30 years ago. It is a 6-thiopurine analogue of the naturally occurring purine bases hypoxanthine and guanine. Intracellular activation results in incorporation into DNA as a false purine base. An additional cytotoxic effect is related to its incorporation into RNA. Thioguanine is cross-resistant with mercaptopurine. Cytotoxicity is cell cycle phase-specific (S-phase).","Thioguanine competes with hypoxanthine and guanine for the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase) and is itself converted to 6-thioguanilyic acid (TGMP), which reaches high intracellular concentrations at therapeutic doses. TGMP interferes with the synthesis of guanine nucleotides by its inhibition of purine biosynthesis by pseudofeedback inhibition of glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, the first enzyme unique to the de novo pathway of purine ribonucleotide synthesis. TGMP also inhibits the conversion of inosinic acid (IMP) to xanthylic acid (XMP) by competition for the enzyme IMP dehydrogenase. Thioguanine nucleotides are incorporated into both the DNA and the RNA by phosphodiester linkages, and some studies have shown that incorporation of such false bases contributes to the cytotoxicity of thioguanine. Its tumor inhibitory properties may be due to one or more of its effects on feedback inhibition of de novo purine synthesis; inhibition of purine nucleotide interconversions; or incorporation into the DNA and RNA.

These genes make the enzymes that are critical for producing and recycling tetrahydrobiopterin. If one of the enzymes fails to function correctly because of a gene mutation, little or no tetrahydrobiopterin is produced. As a result, phenylalanine from the diet builds up in the bloodstream and other tissues and can damage nerve cells in the brain. High levels of phenylalanine can result in signs and symptoms ranging from temporary low muscle tone to mental retardation, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, seizures, behavioral problems, progressive problems with development, and an inability to control body temperature.","Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a natural co-factor or co-enzyme for phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase (PAH),Tetrahydrobiopterine, and tryptophan-5-hydroxylase.

Therefore BH4 is required for the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, for the production of epinephrine (adrenaline) and the synthesis of the monoamine neuro-transmitters, serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). It is also involved in apoptosis and other cellular events mediated by nitric oxide production. As a coenzyme, BH4 reacts with molecular oxygen to form an active oxygen intermediate that can hydroxylate substrates. In the hydroxylation process, the co-enzyme loses two electrons and is regenerated in vivo in an NADH-dependent reaction.

","
Vinorelbine is a semi-synthetic vinca-alkaloid with a wide spectrum of anti-tumor activity. The vinca-alkaloids are considered spindle poisons. They work by interfering with the polymerization of tubulin, a protein responsible for building the microtubule system which appears during cell division in proliferating cancer cells [L2007].","Vinca alkaloids are structurally similar compounds composed of two multi-ringed units, _vindoline_, and _catharanthine_. _Vinorelbine tartrate_ is a vinca alkaloid in which the catharanthine component is the target of structural modification [L2005], [L2006].

This structural modification contributes to unique pharmacologic properties.The antitumor activity of vinorelbine tartrate is believed to be owed to the inhibition of mitosis at metaphase via its interaction with tubulin [L1998].

Vinorelbine is a mitotic spindle poison that interferes with chromosomal segregation during mitosis, also known as cell division. It pauses cells at the _G2/M_ phases, when present at concentrations close to the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). Microtubules, which are derived from polymers of tubulin, are the main target of vinorelbine. 

The chemical modification used to produce vinorelbine allows for the opening of the eight-member catharanthine ring with the formation of both a covalent and reversible bond with tubulin [L2007].

The relative contribution of different microtubule-associated proteins in the production of tubulin vary between neural tissue and proliferating cells and this has important functional implications. The ability of vinorelbine to bind specifically to mitotic rather than other microtubules has been shown and may suggest that neurotoxicity is less likely to be a problem than with the molecular mechanism of action [L2007]. 

As with other anti-microtubule agents, vinorelbine is known to contribute apoptosis in malignant cells. The exact mechanisms by which this process occurs are complex and many details are yet to be elucidated. The disarray of the microtubule structure has a number of effects, including the induction of tumor suppressor gene _p53_ and activation/inactivation of a number of protein kinases involved in essential signaling pathways, including _p21 WAF1/CIP1_ and _Ras/Raf_, _PKC/PKA_. These molecular changes lead to phosphorylation and consequently inactivation of the apoptosis inhibitor _Bcl2_. This, in turn, results in a decrease in the formation of heterodimers between _Bcl2_ and the pro-apoptotic gene _BAX_, stimulating the sequence of cell apoptosis [L2007].

Vinorelbine tartrate also possibly interferes with amino acid, cyclic AMP and glutathione metabolism, calmodulin-dependent Ca++-transport ATPase activity, cellular respiration, and nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis [L1998].
","
Vinorelbine undergoes substantial hepatic elimination in humans. Two metabolites of vinorelbine have been identified in human blood, plasma, and urine; vinorelbine N-oxide and deacetylvinorelbine. Deacetylvinorelbine has been demonstrated to be the primary metabolite of vinorelbine in humans, and has been shown to possess antitumor activity similar to vinorelbine [L2005], [L2006].

Vinorelbine is metabolized into two other minor metabolites, 20'-hydroxyvinorelbine and vinorelbine 6'-oxide [L2006].

Therapeutic doses of vinorelbine (30 mg/m2) yield very small, if any, quantifiable levels of either metabolite in blood or urine. The metabolism of vinorelbine is mediated by hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the CYP3A subfamily [L2004], [A32354].

As the liver provides the main route for metabolism of the drug, patients with hepatic impairment may demonstrate increased toxicity with standard dosing, however, there are no available data on this. Likewise, the contribution of cytochrome P450 enzyme action to vinorelbine metabolism has potential implications in patients receiving other drugs metabolized by this route [L2007].","Vinorelbine is rapidly absorbed with peak serum concentration reached within 2 hours [L1998].

Vinorelbine is highly bound to platelets and lymphocytes and is also bound to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, albumin, and lipoproteins [A32354].","The terminal phase half-life averaged 27.7 to 43.6 hours; the mean plasma clearances ranged from 0.97 to 1.26 L/hr/kg [A32354].","80-90% [L2000]","Vinorelbine undergoes substantial hepatic elimination in humans, with large amounts recovered in feces after intravenous administration to humans [L1998].

**Gastrointestinal:** Mild or moderate nausea symptoms occurred in 32% of NSCLC and 47% of breast cancer patients treated with vinorelbine tartrate. Severe nausea was occurred infrequently (1% and 3% in NSCLC and breast cancer patients, respectively). Prophylactic administration of anti-emetics was not routine in patients treated with single-agent vinorelbine tartrate. Constipation occurred in about 28% of NSCLC and 38% of breast cancer patients. The paralytic ileus incidence of less than 2% of patients. Vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia and stomatitis were found to be mild or moderate and occurred in less than 20% of study patients [L1998].

**Hepatic:** Transient elevations of liver enzymes were reported without clinical symptoms.
**Cardiovascular:** Chest pain was reported in 5% of NSCLC and 8% of breast cancer patients. Most reports of chest pain were in patients who had either a history of cardiovascular disease or tumor within the chest. There have been rare reports of myocardial infarction; however, these have not been shown definitely attributable to vinorelbine tartrate [L2004].

**Other:** Muscle weakness (asthenia) occurred in about 25% of patients with NSCLC and 41% of patients with breast cancer. It was usually mild or moderate but showed a linear increase with cumulative doses [L2004].

Mirtazapine is effective in treating moderate to severe depression and treats many symptoms normally associated with this condition. These symptoms may include disturbed sleep, lack of appetite, and anhedonia, in addition to anxiety.[A555,A178150,T595]. It is important to note that suicidal ideation and behavior may emerge or increase during treatment with mirtazapine, as with any other antidepressant. This risk is especially pronounced in younger individuals. Patients, medical professionals, and families should monitor for suicidal thoughts, worsening depression, anxiety, agitation, sleep changes, irritable behavior, aggression, impulsivity, restlessness, and other unusual behavior when this drug is taken or the dose is adjusted.[FDA label] Do not administer mirtazapine to children. When deciding to prescribe this drug, carefully consider the increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, especially in young adults.[FDA label]

**Effects on appetite and weight gain**

In addition to the above effects, mirtazapine exerts stimulating effects on appetite, and has been used for increasing appetite and decreasing nausea in cancer patients.[A177952, A177958]  Some studies and case reports have shown that this drug improves eating habits and weight gain in patients suffering from anorexia nervosa when administered in conjunction with psychotherapy and/or other psychotropic drugs.[A177961,A178186] In a clinical trial, women with depression experienced a clinically significant mean increase in body weight, fat mass, and concentrations of leptin when treated with mirtazapine for a 6-week period, with a lack of effect on glucose homeostasis.[A177970]

**Effects on sleep**

The use of mirtazapine to treat disordered sleep has been leveraged from its tendency to cause somnolence, which is a frequently experienced adverse effect by patients taking this drug.[A177808,A177994,FDA label] Mirtazapine has been shown to exert beneficial effects on sleep latency, duration, and quality due to its sedating properties.[A177967] Insomnia is a common occurrence in patients with depression, and mirtazapine has been found to be efficacious in treating this condition.[A177808]","**Summary**

The mechanism of action of mirtazapine is not fully understood[FDA label] but may be explained by its effects on central adrenergic and serotonergic activity. This drug exhibits a fast onset of action, a high level of response, a manageable side-effect profile, and dual noradrenergic and serotonergic effects that are unique from the effects of other antidepressants.[A177811]

**Effects on various receptors**

It has been shown that both noradrenergic and serotonergic activity increase following mirtazapine administration. The results of these studies demonstrate mirtazapine exerts antagonist activity at presynaptic a2-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors in the central nervous system. This is thought to lead to enhanced noradrenergic and serotonergic activity [FDA label], which are known to improve the symptoms of depression and form the basis of antidepressant therapy.[A178198, A178201]

Mirtazapine is a strong antagonist of serotonin 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. It has not been found to bind significantly to the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors [FDA label] but indirectly increases 5-HT1A transmission.[A4709]  

In addition to the above effects, mirtazapine is a peripheral a1-adrenergic antagonist. This action may explain episodes of orthostatic hypotension that have been reported after mirtazapine use.[FDA label] Mirtazapine is a potent histamine (H1) receptor antagonist, which may contribute to its powerful sedating effects.[FDA label] The pain-relieving effects of mirtazapine may be explained by its effects on opioid receptors.[A13073,A177868]","Mirtazapine is heavily metabolized in humans.[FDA label] Demethylation and hydroxylation and subsequent glucuronide conjugation are the major pathways by which mirtazapine is metabolized.[A177826,FDA label] Data from in vitro studies on human liver microsomes show that cytochrome 2D6 and 1A2 lead to the formation of the _8-hydroxy metabolite_ of mirtazapine. The  CYP3A enzyme metabolizes this drug into its _N-desmethyl and N-oxide_ metabolites. There are various other unconjugated metabolites of this drug that are pharmacologically active, but are measured in the blood at limited concentrations.[FDA label, A177826]","The absorption of this drug is rapid and complete.[A177826, FDA label] Due to first pass metabolism in the liver and metabolism in the gut wall, absolute bioavailability is about 50%.[FDA label,A177826] Peak blood concentrations are attained within about 2 hours after an oral dose. Food has little effect on the absorption of mirtazapine, and no dose adjustment is required if it is taken with food.[FDA label] Steady-state levels are achieved by about 5 days after the initial dose.[FDA label, A177826] Mirtazapine pharmacokinetics vary across gender and age range. Females and the elderly population have been shown to have higher blood concentrations in comparison to males and younger adults.[A177826]","20-40 hours [FDA label, A177826]","Mirtazapine is about 85% bound to plasma proteins.[A177826,FDA label]","This drug is mainly excreted by the kidney.

","Total body clearance in males was found to be 31 L/h in a clinical pharmacokinetics study after intravenous administration.[A177826] 

**Clearance in elderly patients** 

Mirtazapine clearance is slower in the elderly than in younger subjects.  Exercise caution when this drug is given to elderly patients. In a clinical trial, elderly males showed a marked decrease in mirtazapine clearance when compared to young males taking the same dose. This difference was less significant when clearance was compared between elderly females and younger females taking mirtazapine.[FDA label] 

**Clearance in hepatic and renal impairment**

Patients with hepatic and renal impairment have decreased rates of clearance and dosage adjustments may be necessary for these patients.[FDA label] Moderate renal impairment and hepatic impairment cause about a 30% decrease in mirtazapine clearance. Severe renal impairment leads to a 50% decrease in mirtazapine clearance.[A177826]","AvanzaSchering-PloughAxitAlphapharmMirtabeneratiopharmMirtazPinewoodMirtazonSchering-PloughNorsetMSD FrancePromyrtilSchering-PloughRemergilMerck Sharp & DohmeRemergonOrganonRexerSchering-PloughZispinOrganon",0,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00370.pdf?1556662532","//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00370.pdf?1265922742",1,1671,"**LD50**

**Overdose information**

Activated charcoal should be administered during an overdose to absorb excess mirtazapine. General supportive therapy should be employed, including maintenance of an adequate airway, oxygen therapy, and ventilation therapy. Vital signs and cardiac rhythm must be monitored. It is not advisable to induce vomiting. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with proper protection of the airway is recommended [FDA label]. There is no antidote for mirtazapine available currently.[FDA label] Consider the possibility of mirtazapine combined with other drugs in an overdose and ensure to contact the local poison control center for guidance on management.[FDA label]
 
**Carcinogenesis**

At higher than normal doses, mirtazapine increased the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in male mice. The highest doses administered to the mice were about 20 and 12 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD).[FDA label] Hepatocellular tumors and thyroid follicular adenoma/cystadenomas in male rats occurred at an increased rate at a higher mirtazapine dose (60 mg/kg/day). In female rats, both the medium (20 mg/kg/day) and higher (60 mg/kg/day) doses of mirtazapine increased the rate of hepatocellular adenomas.[FDA label]  The relevance of these findings in humans is not known at this time.[FDA label]

**Impairment of Fertility**

Mirtazapine was administered to rats at doses reaching 100 mg/kg (equivalent to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose) in a fertility study. There was no impact on mating and conception, however, there was a disturbance of reproductive (estrous) cycling at higher doses.  These doses were measured to be at least 3 times the maximum recommended human dose. Loss of fetus before implantation in the uterus occurred when doses equivalent to 20 times the maximum recommended dose were administered.[FDA label]

**Use in pregnancy**

This drug is categorized as a pregnancy category C drug. No adequate studies in pregnant women have been conducted.  In rats, an increased rate of post-implantation demise occurred with mirtazapine administration. Additionally, an increase in deaths of rat pups during the first 3 days of lactation with a decrease in pup birth weight was noted. Studies on animals are not always relevant to human response. Mirtazapine should be used during pregnancy only if the clinical need outweighs the possible risks to the fetus.[FDA label]

**Use in nursing**

Whether this drug is excreted in human milk is unknown.[FDA label] Many drugs are found excreted in human breast milk, therefore caution is advised if this drug is used during nursing.[FDA label]"

When administered in the tablet form, it reduces blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output, and decreases sympathetic activity.[A179506,A179509,A179512,L6727]. This drug has a fast onset of action, usually occurring within 20 minutes of the administration of an ophthalmic dose. Timolol maleate can exert pharmacological actions for as long as 24 hours if given in the 0.5% or 0.25% doses.[L6757]

","Timolol competes with adrenergic neurotransmitters for binding to beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and the beta(2)-receptors in the vascular and bronchial smooth muscle. This leads to diminished actions of catecholamines, which normally bind to adrenergic receptors and exert sympathetic effects leading to an increase in blood pressure and heart rate.[A179521] Beta(1)-receptor blockade by timolol leads to a decrease in both heart rate and cardiac output during rest and exercise, and a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.[A179524,A179527] In addition to this, a reduction in reflex orthostatic hypotension may also occur. The blockade of beta(2) receptors by timolol in the blood vessels leads to a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, reducing blood pressure.[L6724,L6727,L6733]

The exact mechanism by which timolol reduces ocular pressure is unknown at this time, however, it likely decreases the secretion of aqueous humor in the eye.[L6730] According to one study, the reduction of aqueous humor secretion may occur through the decreased blood supply to the ciliary body resulting from interference with the active transport system or interference with prostaglandin biosynthesis.[A179515]","Timolol is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme, with minor contributions from CYP2C19.[A179551,L6724] 15-20% of a dose undergoes first-pass metabolism.[A179560] Despite its relatively low first pass metabolism, timolol is 90% metabolized.[A179560] Four metabolites of timolol have been identified, with a hydroxy metabolite being the most predominant.[A179551]","The systemic bioavailability of the ophthalmic eyedrop in one study of healthy volunteers was 78.0 ± 24.5% [A179539], indicating that caution must be observed when this drug is administered, as it may be significantly absorbed and have various systemic effects.

PAH is characterized by symptoms of shortness of breath during physical exertion. The condition can ultimately lead to heart failure. Treprostinil is a potent oral antiplatelet agent. The major pharmacologic actions of treprostinil are direct vasodilation of pulmonary and systemic arterial vascular beds and inhibition of platelet aggregation.

"DB00375","APRD00884","small molecule",2005-06-13,2019-07-02,"Colestipol","Bile acid sequestrants like colestipol have been in use since the 1970s.[FDA Label, F4555, F4567, L6262] And even though such an agent may very well be useful in reducing elevated cholesterol levels and decreasing the risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia, colestipol is still generally only employed as an adjunct therapy and the relatively physical nature of its pharmacological activity sometimes limits its usefulness.[FDA Label, F4555, F4567, L6262]

In particular, as colestipol's general mechanism of action ultimately results in the decreased absorption and enhanced secretion of bile acids and lipids in the feces, patients who take complicated medication regimens, experience constipation or biliary obstruction, etc. may not be good candidates for using the agent owing to its physical effects on the gut.[FDA Label, F4555, F4567, L6262]

Alternatively, colestipol predominantly elicits its activities within the gut environment because it undergoes little absorption and metabolism.[FDA Label, F4555, F4567, L6262] The resultant lack of systemic exposure consequently means the medication generally demonstrates very few adverse effects inside the body.[FDA Label, F4555, F4567, L6262]","26658-42-4","K50N755924",NA,NA,"solid",1,0,0,3,"Lednicer, D. and Peery,C.Y.; US. Patent 3,803,237; April 9, 1974; assigned to The Upjohn Co.","Colestipol is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for the reduction of elevated serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (a condition that features elevated LDL-C) who do not respond adequately to diet [FDA Label, L6115, F4555].

Therapy with lipid-altering agents like colestipol should be a component of multiple risk factor intervention in those individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia [FDA Label, L6115, F4555]. Treatment should begin and continue with dietary therapy [FDA Label, L6115, F4555]. In general, a minimum of six months of intensive dietary therapy and counseling should be carried out prior to initiation of drug therapy such as that with colestipol [FDA Label, F4555]. Shorter periods may be considered in patients with severe elevations of LDL-C or with definite coronary heart disease [FDA Label, F4555].

Although colestipol is effective in all types of hypercholesterolemia, some regional prescribing information note in particular that it is medically most appropriate in patients with Fredrickson's type II hyperlipoproteinemia [L6115]. Nevertheless, in patients with combined hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, although colestipol may be helpful in reducing elevated cholesterol, it is not formally indicated where hypertriglyceridemia is the abnormality of greatest concern [F4567].","Cholesterol is the major, and probably the sole precursor of bile acids [FDA Label, F4555]. During normal digestion, bile acids are secreted via the bile from the liver and gall bladder into the intestines [FDA Label, F4555]. Bile acids emulsify the fat and lipid materials present in food, thus facilitating absorption [FDA Label, F4555]. A major portion of the bile acids secreted is reabsorbed from the intestines and returned via the portal circulation to the liver, thus completing the enterohepatic cycle [FDA Label, F4555]. Only very small amounts of bile acids are found in normal serum [FDA Label, F4555].

Colestipol hydrochloride binds bile acids in the intestine forming a complex that is excreted in the feces [FDA Label, F4555]. This nonsystemic action results in a partial removal of the bile acids from the enterohepatic circulation, preventing their reabsorption [FDA Label, F4555]. Since colestipol hydrochloride is an anion exchange resin, the chloride anions of the resin can be replaced by other anions, usually those with a greater affinity for the resin than the chloride ion [FDA Label, F4555].","Colestipol is a lipid-lowering polymer that binds with bile acids in the intestine forming a complex that is excreted in the feces [FDA Label, F4555, F4567]. This non-systemic action results in a continuous, partial removal of bile acids from the enterohepatic circulation preventing their reabsorption [FDA Label, F4555, F4567]. This increased fecal loss of bile acids due to colestipol hydrochloride administration leads to increased oxidation of cholesterol to bile acids [FDA Label, F4555, F4567]. This results in an increase in the number of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, and consequently an increased uptake of LDL and a decrease in serum/plasma beta lipoprotein or total and LDL cholesterol levels [FDA Label, F4555, F4567]. Although hydrochloride produces an increase in the hepatic synthesis of cholesterol in man, serum cholesterol levels fall [FDA Label, F4555, F4567].","Colestipol is not absorbed into the systemic circulation nor is it hydrolyzed by any digestive enzymes [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567].","Colestipol is hydrophilic, but it is virtually water-insoluble (99.75%) [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. This water insolubility, combined with the high molecular weight polymer in colestipol basically means the agent and the complexes it forms when it binds with bile acids are not absorbed [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. The action of colestipol is ultimately limited to the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. It binds bile acids in the intestinal lumen and causes them to be excreted in the feces together with the polymer [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. When the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is interrupted, cholesterol conversion to bile acids is enhanced and plasma cholesterol levels are thereby lowered [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567].","Colestipol is not absorbed into the systemic circulation nor is it hydrolyzed by any digestive enzymes [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567].

The location of such potential obstruction, the degree of obstruction and the presence or absence of normal gut motility would determine treatment [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567].

No clinical data are available on the use of colestipol in pregnant women and during lactation [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567].  Colestipol does not appear to be absorbed systematically [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. Due to its known interference with absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, the use of colestipol in pregnancy or lactation or by women of childbearing potential requires that the benefits of drug therapy be weighed against the possible hazards to the mother and the child [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567].

There are no data on the effect of colestipol on fertility in humans [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567].

The use of colestipol in children is limited [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. Clinical trials conducted in children with colestipol ranules have usually employed doses of 5 to 20 g/day [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel recommends drug therapy be considered in children 10 years or older, who have previously undergone an adequate trial of diet therapy but still have unacceptably high serum cholesterol levels [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. In certain situations where a young child has extremely high serum cholesterol levels, drug treatment may even be initiated before 10 years of age [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. If the child is started on drug therapy, a carefully assessed diet therapy should also be continued in order to obtain optimal results [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. However, the safety of using colestipol tablets in patients under the age of 18 years has not been established [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. Furthermore, because bile acid sequestrants like colestipol may interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, appropriate monitoring of growth and development is essential if colestipol is used in children [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567].

Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of colestipol have not been performed in the geriatric population [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. However, patients over 60 years of age may be more likely to experience gastrointestinal side effects, as well as adverse nutritional effects [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567].

Palonosetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist that is pharmacologically related to other 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists, but differs structurally. Palonosetron has a high affinity for 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors, but has little to no affinity for other receptors. The serontonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is suggested that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT3 receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting.","Palonosetron is a selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist. The antiemetic activity of the drug is brought about through the inhibition of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors present both centrally (medullary chemoreceptor zone) and peripherally (GI tract). This inhibition of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in turn inhibits the visceral afferent stimulation of the vomiting center, likely indirectly at the level of the area postrema, as well as through direct inhibition of serotonin activity within the area postrema and the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Alternative mechanisms appear to be primarily responsible for delayed nausea and vomiting induced by emetogenic chemotherapy, since similar temporal relationships between between serotonin and emesis beyond the first day after a dose have not been established, and 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists generally have not appeared to be effective alone in preventing or ameliorating delayed effects.

Patients receiving anthracycline-derivative antineoplastic agents may experience three types of cardiotoxicity: acute transient type; chronic, subacute type (related to cumulative dose and has a more indolent onset later on); and a late-onset type that manifests years after therapy, mainly in patients that have been exposed to the drug as a child. Although the exact mechanism of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is not known, it has shown to exert a variety of actions that may result in the development of cardiotoxicity. In animals, anthracyclines cause a selective inhibition of cardiac muscle gene expression for a-actin, troponin, myosin light-chain 2, and the M isoform of creatine kinase. This may lead to myofibrillar loss associated with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Anthracyclines may also cause myocyte damage via calcium overload, altered myocardial adrenergic function, release of vasoactive amines, and proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the main cause of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is associated with free-radical damage to DNA. The drugs intercalate DNA, chelate metal ions to produce drug-metal complexes, and generate superoxide radicals via oxidation-reduction reactions. Anthracyclines also contain a quinone structure that can undergo reduction via NADPH-dependent reactions to produce a semiquinone free radical that initiates a cascade of superoxide and hydroxide radical generation. Chelation of metal ions, particularly iron, by anthracyclines results in an anthracycline-metal complex that catalyzes the generation of reactive oxygen free radicals. This complex is a powerful oxidant that can initiate lipid peroxidation in the absence of oxygen free radicals. The toxicity induced by antrhacyclines may be exacerbated in cardiac cells, as these cells do not possess sufficient amounts of certain enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase) involved in detoxifying free radicals and protecting the cells from subsequent damage.","The mechanism by which dexrazoxane exerts its cardioprotective activity is not fully understood. Dexrazoxane is a cyclic derivative of EDTA that readily penetrates cell membranes. Results of laboratory studies suggest that dexrazoxane (a prodrug) is converted intracellularly to a ring-opened bidentate chelating agent that chelates to free iron and interferes with iron-mediated free radical generation thought to be responsible, in part, for anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. It should be noted that dexrazoxane may also be protective through its inhibitory effect on topoisomerase II.","Dexrazoxane is hydrolysed by the enzyme dihydropyrimidine amidohydrolase in the liver and kidney to active metabolites that are capable of binding to metal ions.","IV administration results in complete bioavailability.","2.5 hours","Very low (< 2%)","Urinary excretion plays an important role in the elimination of dexrazoxane.

Due to their selectivity for the peripheral blood vessels, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are associated with a lower incidence of myocardial depression and cardiac conduction abnormalities than other calcium channel blockers [A175327].

Amlodipine is commonly used in the treatment of high blood pressure and angina. Amlodipine has antioxidant properties and an ability to enhance the production of nitric oxide (NO), an important vasodilator that decreases blood pressure [A175321].  The option for single daily dosing of amlodipine is an attractive feature of this drug [FDA label].","88150-42-9","1J444QC288",408.876,408.145199627,"solid",1,6,0,0,NA,"Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive and antianginal agents for the treatment of the following conditions [FDA label]:

• Chronic stable angina

• Vasospastic angina (Prinzmetal’s or Variant angina) 

• Angiographically documented coronary artery disease in patients without heart failure or an ejection fraction < 40%","**General pharmacodynamic effects**

Amlodipine has a strong affinity for cell membranes, modulating calcium influx by inhibiting selected membrane calcium channels. This drug's unique binding properties allow for its long-acting action and less frequent dosing regimen [A573], [FDA label].  

**Hemodynamic effects**

After the administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine to patients diagnosed with hypertension, amlodipine causes vasodilation, which results in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressure. During these blood pressure reductions, there are no clinically significant changes in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with long-term use. Acute intravenous administration of amlodipine reduces arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in patients with chronic stable angina, however, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical studies did not cause clinically significant alterations in heart rate or blood pressures in patients diagnosed with angina and normal blood pressure. With long-term, once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours [FDA label]. 

**Electrophysiologic effects**

Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial (SA) nodal function or atrioventricular (AV) conduction in animals or humans. In patients who were diagnosed with chronic stable angina, the intravenous administration of 10 mg of amlodipine did not cause clinically significant alterations A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after cardiac pacing. Patients administered amlodipine with concomitant beta-blockers produced similar results. In clinical trials in which amlodipine was given in combination with beta-blockers to patients diagnosed with hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were noted. In clinical studies comprised of angina patients alone, amlodipine did not change electrocardiographic intervals or produce high degrees of AV block [FDA label]. 

**Effects on angina**

Amlodipine relieves the symptoms of chest pain associated with angina. In patients diagnosed with angina, daily administration of a single amlodipine dose increases total exercise time, the time to angina onset, and the time to 1 mm ST-segment depression on ECG studies, decreases anginal attack frequency, and decreases the requirement for nitroglycerin tablets [F3757].","**Mechanism of action on blood pressure**

Amlodipine is considered a peripheral arterial vasodilator that exerts its action directly on vascular smooth muscle to lead to a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, causing a decrease in blood pressure. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the influx of calcium ions into both vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental studies imply that amlodipine binds to both _dihydropyridine_ and _nondihydropyridine_ binding sites, located on cell membranes. The contraction of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent on the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells by specific ion channels. Amlodipine blocks calcium ion influx across cell membranes with selectivity. A stronger effect of amlodipine is exerted on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells [FDA label]. Direct actions of amlodipine on vascular smooth muscle result in reduced blood pressure [F3757]. 

**Mechanism of action in angina**

The exact mechanism by which amlodipine relieves the symptoms of angina have not been fully elucidated to this date, however, the mechanism of action is likely twofold:

Amlodipine has a dilating effect on peripheral arterioles, reducing the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the cardiac muscle functions. Since the heart rate remains stable during amlodipine administration, the reduced work of the heart reduces both myocardial energy use and oxygen requirements [F3757].

Dilatation of the main coronary arteries and coronary arterioles, both in healthy and ischemic areas, is another possible mechanism of amlodipine reduction of blood pressure. The dilatation causes an increase in myocardial oxygen delivery in patients experiencing coronary artery spasm (Prinzmetal's or variant angina) and reduces coronary vasoconstriction caused by smoking [F3757].","Amlodipine is heavily (approximately 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic breakdown with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites found excreted in the urine. _Ex vivo_ studies have shown that about 93% of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients [FDA label].  Characteristics that add to amlodipine's unique pharmacologic profile include nearly complete absorption, late-peak plasma concentrations, high bioavailability, and slow hepatic breakdown [A574].","Amlodipine absorbed slowly and almost completely from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak plasma concentrations are achieved 6-12 hours after oral administration. The estimated bioavailability of amlodipine is 64-90%. Steady-state plasma amlodipine levels are achieved after 7-8 days of consecutive daily dosing. Absorption is not affected by food [FDA label].","The terminal elimination half-life of about 30–50 hours [FDA label].

It works by promoting the excretion of sodium ions and water while decreasing the potassium excretion in the distal part of the nephron in the kidneys by working on the lumenal side.[A177985] Since it acts on the distal nephron where only a small fraction of sodium ion reabsorption occurs, triamterene is reported to have limited diuretic efficacy.[T28] Due to its effects on increased serum potassium levels, triamterene is associated with a risk of producing hyperkalemia.

It primarily works on the distal nephron in the kidneys; it acts from the late distal tubule to the collecting duct to inhibit Na+ reabsorption and decreasing K+ excretion.[T28] As triamterene tends to conserve potassium more strongly than promoting Na+ excretion, it can cause an increase in serum potassium, which may result in hyperkalemia potentially associated with cardiac irregularities.[Label] In healthy volunteers administered with oral triamterene, there was an increase in the renal clearnace of sodium and magnesium, and a decrease in the clearance of uric acid and creatinine[A178039] due to its effect of reducing glomerular filtration renal plasma flow.[L6169] Triamterene does not affect calcium excretion.[L6169] In clinical trials, the use of triamterene in combination with hydrochlorothiazide resulted an enhanced blood pressure-lowering effects of hydrochlorothiazide.[A178048]","Triamterene inhibits the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) located on the lumenal side in the late distal convoluted tubule and collecting tubule [A178042], which are transmembrane channels that normally promotes sodium uptake and potassium secretion.[A178048] In the late distal tubule to the collecting duct, sodium ions are actively reabsorbed via ENaC on the lumnial membrane and are extruded out of the cell into the peritubular medium by a sodium-potassium exchange pump, the Na-K-ATPase,[A178054] with water following passively.[T28] Triamterene exerts a diuretic effect on the distal renal tubule to inhibit the reabsorption of sodium ions in exchange for potassium and hydrogen ions and its natriuretic activity is limited by the amount of sodium reaching its site of action.[L6169] Its action is antagonistic to that of adrenal mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone, but it is not an inhibitor or antagonist of aldosterone.[Label] Triamterene maintains or increases the sodium excretionm, thereby increasing the excretion of water, and reduces the excess loss of potassium, hydrogen and chloride ions by inhibiting the distal tubular exchange mechanism.[L6169] Due to its diuretic effect, triamterene rapidly and reversibly reduces the lumen-negative transepithelial potential difference by almost complete abolition of Na+ conductance without altering K+ conductance.[A177988] This reduces the driving force for potassium movement into the tubular lumen and thus decreases potassium excretion.

This drug originates from the foxglove plant, also known as the _Digitalis_ plant[T610], studied by William Withering, an English physician and botanist in the 1780s.[A178237,A178240] Prior to this, a Welsh family, historically referred to as the _Physicians of Myddvai_, formulated drugs from this plant.

In adults with heart failure, when it is clinically possible, digoxin should be administered in conjunction with a diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for optimum effects.[L6775]

","Digoxin is a positive inotropic and negative chronotropic drug[A178234], meaning that it increases the force of the heartbeat and decreases the heart rate.[L6253] The decrease in heart rate is particularly useful in cases of atrial fibrillation, a condition characterized by a fast and irregular heartbeat.[A178282] The relief of heart failure symptoms during digoxin therapy has been demonstrated in clinical studies by increased exercise capacity and reduced hospitalization due to heart failure and reduced heart failure-related emergency medical visits.[L6775] Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic window.[L6775]

**A note on cardiovascular risk**

Digoxin poses a risk of rapid ventricular response that can cause ventricular fibrillation in patients with an accessory atrioventricular (AV) pathway. Cardiac arrest as a result of ventricular fibrillation is fatal.[L6775] An increased risk of fatal severe or complete heart block is present in individuals with pre-existing sinus node disease and AV block who take digoxin.[L6775]

","Digoxin exerts hemodynamic, electrophysiologic, and neurohormonal effects on the cardiovascular system.[A178234] It reversibly inhibits the Na-K ATPase enzyme, leading to various beneficial effects.  The Na-K ATPase enzyme functions to maintain the intracellular environment by regulating the entry and exit of sodium, potassium, and calcium (indirectly). Na-K ATPase is also known as the _sodium pump_[L6775]. The inhibition of the sodium pump by digoxin increases intracellular sodium and increases the calcium level in the myocardial cells, causing an increased contractile force of the heart.[L6775, A178264] This improves the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), an important measure of cardiac function.[A178234,T613]

Digoxin also stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system via the vagus nerve[T607] leading to sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) node effects, decreasing the heart rate.[L6775,A178234] Part of the pathophysiology of heart failure includes neurohormonal activation, leading to an increase in norepinephrine. Digoxin helps to decrease norepinephrine levels through activation of the parasympathetic nervous system.[A178234]","About 13% of a digoxin dose is found to be metabolized in healthy subjects. Several urinary metabolites of digoxin exist, including _dihydrodigoxin_ and _digoxigenin bisdigitoxoside_. Their glucuronidated and sulfated conjugates are thought to be produced through the process of hydrolysis, oxidation, and additionally, conjugation. The cytochrome P-450 system does not play a major role in digoxin metabolism, nor does this drug induce or inhibit the enzymes in this system.[L6775]","Digoxin is approximately 70-80% absorbed in the first part of the small bowel.[A178228]  The bioavailability of an oral dose varies from 50-90%, however, oral gelatinized capsules of digoxin are reported to have a bioavailability of 100%.[A178252] Tmax, or the time to reach the maximum concentration of digoxin was measured to be 1.0 h in one clinical study of healthy patients taking 0.25 mg of digoxin with a placebo.[A178369] Cmax, or maximum concentration, was 1.32 ± 0.18 ng/ml-1 in the same study, and AUC (area under the curve) was 12.5 ± 2.38 ng/ml-1.[A178369]
If digoxin is ingested after a meal, absorption is slowed but this does not change the total amount of absorbed drug. If digoxin is taken with meals that are in fiber, absorption may be decreased.[L6274]

**A note on gut bacteria**

An oral dose of digoxin may be transformed into pharmacologically inactive products by bacteria in the colon. Studies have indicated that 10% of patients receiving digoxin tablets will experience the degradation of at least 40% of an ingested dose of digoxin by gut bacteria. Several antibiotics may increase the absorption of digoxin in these patients, due to the elimination of gut bacteria, which normally cause digoxin degradation.[L6775] 

**A note on malabsorption**

Patients with malabsorption due to a variety of causes may have a decreased ability to absorb digoxin.[L6775] P-glycoprotein, located on cells in the intestine, may interfere with digoxin pharmacokinetics, as it is a substrate of this efflux transporter. P-glycoprotein can be induced by other drugs, therefore reducing the effects of digoxin by increasing its efflux in the intestine.[L6775]","Digoxin has a half-life of 1.5-2 days in healthy subjects.[L6775] The half-life in patients who do not pass urine, usually due to renal failure, is prolonged to 3.5-5 days.  Since most of the drug is distributed extravascularly, dialysis and exchange transfusion are not optimal methods for the removal of digoxin.[L6775]","Digoxin protein binding is approximately 25%.[L6775] It is mainly bound to albumin.[A178228]","The elimination of digoxin is proportional to the total dose, following first order kinetics. After intravenous (IV) administration to healthy subjects, 50-70% of the dose is measured excreted as unchanged digoxin in the urine.  Approximately 25 to 28% of digoxin is eliminated outside of the kidney. Biliary excretion appears to be of much less importance than renal excretion.[A178228]

Digoxin is not effectively removed from the body by dialysis, exchange transfusion, or during cardiopulmonary bypass because most of the drug is bound to extravascular tissues.[L6775]","This drug is widely distributed in the body, and is known to cross the blood-brain barrier and the placenta.[L6775,A178228] The apparent volume of distribution of digoxin is 475-500 L.[L6775] A large portion of digoxin is distributed in the skeletal muscle followed by the heart and kidneys.[A178228] It is important to note that the elderly population, generally having a decreased muscle mass, may show a lower volume of digoxin distribution.[L6775]","The clearance of digoxin closely correlates to creatinine clearance, and does not depend on urinary flow. Individuals with renal impairment or failure may exhibit extensively prolonged half-lives. It is therefore important to titrate the dose accordingly and regularly monitor serum digoxin levels.[L6775] One pharmacokinetic study measured the mean body clearance of intravenous digoxin to be 88 ± 44ml/min/l.73 m².[A178324] Another study provided mean clearance values of 53 ml/min/1.73 m² in men aged 73-81 and 83 ml/min/1.73 m² in men aged 20-33 years old after an intravenous digoxin dose.[A178318]","AgoxinAristopharmaCardiacinCenterCardiogoxinMedipharmaCardioxinOboiCardoxinCeloxinCelonCentoxinOpsoninDigacinmibeDigazolanDigocard-GKlonalDigoxinaGlaxoSmithKlineEudigoxTeofarmaLanacordinKernLanacristLanadicorLanicorRocheLenoxinGlaxoSmithKline",3,NA,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00390.pdf?1557506966",6,1614,"Oral TDLO (human female): 100 ug/kg, Oral TDLO (human male): 75 ug/kg, Oral LD50 (rat): 28270 ug/kg[MSDS]

Digoxin toxicity can occur in cases of supratherapeutic dose ingestion or as a result of chronic overexposure.[T607] Digoxin toxicity may be manifested by symptoms of nausea, vomiting, visual changes, in addition to arrhythmia.  Older age,  lower body weight, and decreased renal function or electrolyte abnormalities lead to an increased risk of digoxin toxicity.[L6775]

The tablet form of progesterone in contraceptive formulations is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy [F3904].","Progesterone, depending on concentration and dosage form, and timing of exposure may have several pharmacodynamic effects.  These actions, according, to various preparations, are listed below:

General effects

Progesterone is the main hormone of the corpus luteum and the placenta. It acts on the uterus by changing the proliferative phase to the secretory phase of the endometrium (inner mucous lining of the uterus).   This hormone, stimulated by a hormone called _luteinizing hormone_ (LH) is the main hormone during the secretory phase to prepare the corpus luteum and the endometrium for implantation of a fertilized ovum. As the luteal phase concludes, the progesterone hormone sends negative feedback to the anterior pituitary gland in the brain to decrease FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) levels. This prevents ovulation and maturation of oocytes (immature egg cells). The endometrium then prepares for pregnancy by increasing its vascularity (blood vessels) and stimulating mucous secretion. This process occurs by progesterone stimulating the endometrium to decrease endometrial proliferation, leading to a decreased uterine lining thickness, developing more complex uterine glands, collecting energy in the form of glycogen, and providing more uterine blood vessel surface area suitable for supporting a growing embryo. As opposed to cervical mucous changes observed during the proliferative phase and ovulation, progesterone decreases and thickens the cervical mucus, rendering it less elastic. This change occurs because the fertilization time period has passed, and a specific consistency of mucous amenable to sperm entry is no longer required [T490].

**Gelatinized capsules**

Progesterone capsules are an oral dosage form of micronized progesterone which, chemically identical to progesterone of ovarian origin. Progesterone capsules have all the properties of endogenous progesterone with induction of a secretory phase endometrium with gestagenic, antiestrogenic, slightly antiandrogenic and anti-aldosterone effects [F3913]. Progesterone opposes the effects of estrogen on the uterus, and is beneficial in women with unopposed estrogen exposure, which carries an increased risk of malignancy [F3913].


**Vaginal gel and vaginal insert**

 The gel preparation mimics the effects of naturally occurring progesterone. In the presence of adequate levels of estrogen, progesterone converts a proliferative endometrium into secretory endometrium. This means that the endometrium changes from a growing and thickening stage into a subsequent preparation stage for pregnancy, which involves further preparatory changes. Progesterone is necessary for the development of decidual tissue (specialized tissue amenable to supporting a possible pregnancy). Progesterone is required to increase endometrial receptivity for the implantation of a fertilized embryo. Once an embryo is implanted, progesterone helps to maintain the pregnancy [F3898]. 


**Injection (intramuscular)**

 Intramuscularly injected progesterone increases serum progesterone and aids in the prevention of endometrial tissue overgrowth due to unopposed estrogen (which leads to abnormal uterine bleeding and sometimes uterine cancer) [L5638], [F3916]. In the absence or deficiency of progesterone, the endometrium continually proliferates, eventually outgrowing its limited blood supply, shedding incompletely, and leading to abnormal and/or profuse bleeding as well as malignancy [L5638].

**Tablets, contraceptive**

Progesterone-only contraceptive tablets prevent conception by suppressing ovulation in about half of users, causing a thickening of cervical mucus to inhibit sperm movement, lowering the midcycle LH and FSH hormone peaks, slowing the movement of the ovum through the fallopian tubes, and causing secretory changes in the endometrium as described above [F3904].","Progesterone binds and activates its nuclear receptor, _PR_, which plays an important part in the signaling of stimuli that maintain the endometrium during its preparation for pregnancy.

Progesterone receptor (PR) is a member of the nuclear/steroid hormone receptor (SHR) family of ligand-dependent transcription factors that is expressed primarily in female reproductive tissue as well as the central nervous system. As a result of its binding its associated steroid hormone, progesterone, the progesterone receptor (PR) modulates the expression of genes that regulate the development, differentiation, and proliferation of target tissues [A175666]. In humans, PR is found to be highly expressed in the stromal (connective tissue) cells during the secretory phase and during pregnancy [A175651]. 

Progesterone may prevent pregnancy by changing the consistency of cervical mucus to be unfavorable for sperm penetration, and by inhibiting follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which normally causes ovulation.  With perfect use, the first-year failure rate for progestin-only oral contraceptives is approximately 0.5%. The typical failure rate, however, is estimated to be approximately 5%, due to late or missed pills [F3904].","Progesterone is mainly metabolized by the liver. After oral administration, the major plasma metabolites found are 20 a hydroxy-<U+0394>4 a-prenolone and 5 a-dihydroprogesterone. Some progesterone metabolites are found excreted in the bile and these metabolites may be deconjugated and subsequently metabolized in the gut by reduction, dehydroxylation, and epimerization [FDA label]. The major plasma and urinary metabolites are comparable to those found during the physiological progesterone secretion of the corpus luteum [F3913].","**Oral micronized capsules**

Following oral administration of progesterone in the micronized soft-gelatin capsule formulation, peak serum concentration was achieved in the first 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of micronized progesterone is unknown at this time.  In postmenopausal women, serum progesterone concentration increased in a dose-proportional and linear fashion after multiple doses of progesterone capsules, ranging from 100 mg/day to 300 mg/day [FDA label]. 

**IM administration**

After intramuscular (IM) administration of 10 mg of progesterone in oil, the maximum plasma concentrations were achieved in about 8 hours post-injection and plasma concentrations stayed above baseline for approximately 24 hours post-injection. Injections of 10, 25, and 50 mg lead to geometric mean values for maximum plasma concentration (CMAX) of 7, 28, and 50 ng/mL, respectively [F3916]. Progesterone administered by the intramuscular (IM) route avoids significant first-pass hepatic metabolism. As a result, endometrial tissue concentrations of progesterone achieved with IM administration are higher when compared with oral administration. Despite this, the highest concentrations of progesterone in endometrial tissue are reached with vaginal administration [A175657]. 

**Note on oral contraceptive tablet absorption**

Serum progestin levels peak about 2 hours after oral administration of progesterone-only contraceptive tablets, followed by rapid distribution and elimination. By 24 hours after drug administration, serum levels remain near the baseline, making efficacy dependent upon strict adherence to the dosing schedule. Large variations in serum progesterone levels occur among individuals. Progestin-only administration leads to lower steady-state serum progestin levels and a shorter elimination half-life than concurrent administration with estrogens [F3904].","Absorption half-life is approximately 25-50 hours and an elimination half-life of 5-20 minutes (progesterone gel) [F3898].  

Progesterone, administered orally, has a short serum half-life (approximately 5 minutes). It is rapidly metabolized to _17-hydroxyprogesterone_ during its first pass through the liver [A175657]. 

","96%-99% bound to serum proteins, primarily to serum albumin (50%-54%) and transcortin (43%-48%) [FDA label].
","Progesterone metabolites are excreted mainly by the kidneys. Urinary elimination is observed for 95% of patients in the form of glycuroconjugated metabolites, primarily 3 a, 5 ß–pregnanediol (_pregnandiol_) [F3913]. The glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of pregnanediol and pregnanolone are excreted in the urine and bile. Progesterone metabolites, excreted in the bile, may undergo enterohepatic recycling or may be found excreted in the feces.","When administered vaginally, progesterone is well absorbed by uterine endometrial tissue, and a small percentage is distributed into the systemic circulation.
The amount of progesterone in the systemic circulation appears to be of minimal importance, especially when implantation, pregnancy, and live birth outcomes appear similar for intramuscular and vaginal administration of progesterone [A175657].","**Apparent clearance**

**Use in pregnancy**

Only forms of progesterone that are indicated on product labeling for pregnancy should be used. Some forms of progesterone should not be used in pregnancy [FDA label], [F3904].  Refer to individual product monographs for information regarding use in pregnancy. Many studies have found no effects on fetal development associated with long-term use of contraceptive doses of oral progestins. Studies of infant growth and development that have been conducted have not demonstrated significant adverse effects, however, these studies are few in number. It is therefore advisable to rule out suspected pregnancy before starting any hormonal contraceptive [F3904]. 

**Effects on fertility**

Progesterone at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until cessation [F3916]. The progesterone contraceptive should not be used during pregnancy. 

**Carcinogenicity**

Progesterone has been shown to induce or promote the formation of ovarian, uterine, mammary, and genital tract tumors in animals. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown [F3913]. Certain epidemiological studies of patients using oral contraceptives have reported an increased relative risk of developing breast cancer, especially at a younger age and associated with a longer duration of use. These studies have mainly involved combined oral contraceptives, and therefore, it is unknown whether this risk is attributable to progestins, estrogens, or a combination of both. At this time, there is insufficient data to determine whether the use of progestin-only contraceptives increases the risk in a similar way to combined contraceptives. A meta-analysis of 54 studies showed a small increase in the frequency of breast cancer diagnosis for women who were currently using combined oral contraceptives, or had used them within the past 10 years. There was no increase in the frequency of having breast cancer diagnosed ten or more years after cessation of hormone use. Women with breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives, as there is no sufficient data to fully establish or negate the risk of cancer with hormonal contraceptive use [F3904]. 

**Use in breastfeeding**

Progesterone has been detected in the milk of nursing mothers [F3901], [F3904]. No adverse effects, in general, have been found on breastfeeding ability or on the health, growth, or development of the growing infant. Despite this, isolated post-marketing cases of decreased milk production have been reported [F3904]."

Inhibition of this enzyme in osteoclasts prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids (FPP and GGPP) that are essential for the post-translational farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPase signalling proteins. This activity inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover.

It is a _non-ergot dopamine agonist_ drug that is efficacious in treating various Parkinson's symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slow movement) [A176867]. It was first approved by the FDA in 1997 [L5882]. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders and causes a high level of disability in patients [A176855], leading to increased difficulty in performing activities of daily living due to symptoms that progress over time [A176858]. The prevalence of Parkinson's Disease worldwide has increased from approximately 2.5 million in 1990 to about 6.1 million in 2016 [A176861].  This increase may be attributed to an aging population along with other contributing factors [A176861].

In addition to the above FDA approval for Parkinson's Disease, pramipexole was also approved by the FDA in 2006 for the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) [A176873]. RLS is a sleep-related disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the lower extremities, often accompanied by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs [A176876].","104632-26-0","83619PEU5T",211.327,211.114318249,"solid",2,11,0,1,NA,"This drug is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson’s disease [FDA label].  This drug can be administered as monotherapy or in conjunction with levodopa. It is also indicated for symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe primary Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) [FDA label].","**Parkinson's Disease**

Through the stimulation of dopamine receptors, pramipexole is thought to relieve the symptoms of Parkinson's Disease [FDA label]. The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease occur partly due to a reduction of dopamine in the substantia nigra of the brain [A176894]. Dopamine is an essential neurotransmitter that has major effects on motor movements in humans.

**Restless Legs Syndrome**

Pramipexole likely restores balance to the dopaminergic system, controlling the symptoms of this condition. Restless legs syndrome is thought to occur, in part, through dysfunction of the dopaminergic system, resulting in unpleasant lower extremity symptoms [A176876], [F4301]. 

**Other effects**

In addition to the abovementioned effects, animal studies demonstrate that pramipexole blocks dopamine synthesis, release, and turnover. Additionally, this drug is neuroprotective to dopamine neuron degeneration after ischemia or methamphetamine neurotoxicity [F4301].","The exact mechanism of action of pramipexole as a treatment for Parkinson's disease is unknown at this time. It is thought, however, that the ability of pramipexole to cause stimulation of the dopamine receptors in the striatum of the brain, a region that receives a vast array of neurological input and is responsible for a wide variety of functions, may be involved[A176891].  Studies performed in animals show that pramipexole influences striatal neuronal transmission rates following activation of dopamine receptors  [FDA label]. 

Pramipexole is considered a non-ergot dopamine agonist that shows specificity and strong activity at the D2 subfamily of dopamine receptors in vitro, binding selectively and dopamine D2 receptors and showing a preference for the dopamine D3 receptor subtype rather than other subtypes [A176873]. The clinical significance of this binding specificity is unknown [FDA label], [A176873].

Pramipexole was not found to be carcinogenic in 2-year studies on mice and rats at 0.3, 2.2, and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No increased incidence of tumors was observed [FDA label]. No mutagenicity was detected in various assays, including the Ames test.  Finally, pramipexole given to rat models at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day (5 times the maximum recommended human dose), increased estrus cycles and inhibited implantation of a fertilized ovum. Decreased levels of prolactin, a hormone necessary for implantation and maintenance of early pregnancy, were measured [FDA label]. The significance of these findings in humans is unknown. 

**Pregnancy**

This drug is considered a pregnancy category C drug, showing teratogenic effects in animals. Currently, there no studies of pramipexole in human pregnancy. Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. This drug should only be used in pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the possible fetal risks [FDA label]. 

**Nursing**

Whether pramipexole is excreted in human milk is unknown.  A decision should be made regarding the administration pramipexole during nursing, or whether to discontinue it during nursing, as many drugs are excreted in human milk. The potential exists for risk to the infant if pramipexole is, in fact, excreted in the milk [FDA label]."

Miglustat is now the first and only approved therapy for patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C). It has recently been approved for treatment of progressive neurological symptoms in adult and pediatric patients in the European Union, Brazil, and South Korea.

However, clinical experience with miglustat showed that therapeutic levels of the drug could not be achieved in patients without a high incidence of adverse effect.","72599-27-0","ADN3S497AZ",219.278,219.147058165,"solid",1,7,0,0,NA,"For the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderate type 1 (nonneuropathic) Gaucher's disease for whom enzyme replacement therapy is not a therapeutic option (e.g. due to constraints such as allergy, hypersensitivity, or poor venous access). Now approved in some countries for the treatment of progressive neurological symptoms in adult and pediatric patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C).","Miglustat, an N-alkylated imino sugar, is a synthetic analogue of D-glucose. Miglustat is an inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, which is a glucosyl transferase enzyme responsible for catalyzing the formation of glucosylceramide (glucocerebroside). Glucosylceramide is a substrate for the endogenous glucocerebrosidase, an enzyme that is deficient in Gaucher's disease. The accumulation of glucosylceramide due to the absence of glucocerebrosidase results in the storage of this material in the lysosomes of tissue macrophages, leading to widespread pathology due to infiltration of lipid-engorged macrophages in the viscera, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. This results in secondary hematologic consequences including sever anemia and thrombocytopenia, in addition to the characteristic progressive hepatosplenomegaly, as well as skeletal complications including osteonecrosis and osteopenia with secondary pathological fractures.","Miglustat functions as a competitive and reversible inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, the initial enzyme in a series of reactions which results in the synthesis of most glycosphingolipids. The goal of treatment with miglustat is to reduce the rate of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis so that the amount of glycosphingolipid substrate is reduced to a level which allows the residual activity of the deficient glucocerebrosidase enzyme to be more effective (substrate reduction therapy), reducing the accumulation of glucocerebroside in macrophages. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that miglustat can reduce the synthesis of glucosylceramide-based glycosphingolipids. In clinical trials, miglustat improved liver and spleen volume, as well as hemoglobin concentration and platelet count. Inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis has also shown to reduce intracellular lipid storage, improve fluid-phase endosomal uptake and normalize lipid transport in peripheral blood B lymphocytes of NP-C patients, which results in a decrease in the potentially neurotoxic accumulation of gnagliosides G<sub>M2</sub> and G<sub>M3</sub>, lactosylceramide and glucosylceramide, possibly preventing further neuronal damage. Other studies have also suggested that miglustat may indirectly modulate intracellular calcium homeostasis through its effects on glucosylceramide levels, and evidence has shown that an initiating factor in the pathogenesis of NP-C may be impaired calcium homeostasis related to sphingosine storage. Therefore, the effect that miglustat exerts on intracellular calcium levels may influence an important underlying pathogenic mechanism of NP-C.","There is no evidence that miglustat is metabolized in humans.","Mean oral bioavailability is 97%.","The effective half-life of miglustat is approximately 6 to 7 hours.","Miglustat does not bind to plasma proteins.",NA,NA,NA,NA,2,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00419.pdf?1265922796",NA,1,0,"Miglustat has been administered at doses of up to 3000 mg/day (approximately 10 times the recommended starting dose administered to Gaucher patients) for up to six months in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive patients.

Also known as the marketed products Ritalin, Concerta, or Biphentin, methylphenidate is used with other treatment modalities (psychological, educational, cognitive behaviour therapy, etc) to improve the following group of developmentally inappropriate symptoms associated with ADHD: moderate-to-severe distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. Long-acting formulations of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, [DB01576], and [DB01255] are considered the most effective and widely used treatment for ADHD, and are considered first-line options for children, adolescents, and adults as recommended by CADDRA (Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance) [L6037]. CADDRA recommends the use of methylphenidate due to long term studies, of over twenty years in duration, which show methylphenidate is safe and effective.  

While its exact mechanism is unclear, methylphenidate (MPH) has been shown to act as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), thereby increasing the presence of these neurotransmitters in the extraneuronal space and prolonging their action [A177541]. There is a dose-related effect of psychostimulants on receptor stimulation, where higher doses are shown to increase norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) efflux throughout the brain which can result in impaired cognition and locomotor-activating effects. In contrast, low doses are found to selectively activate NE and DA neurotransmission within the prefrontal cortex which is an area of the brain thought to play a prominent role in ADHD pathophysiology, thereby improving clinical efficacy and preventing side effects [A177547]. The lower doses used to treat ADHD are not associated with the locomotor-activating effects associated with higher doses and instead reduce movement, impulsivity, and increase cognitive function including sustained attention and working memory [A177541, A177544]. Methylphenidate's beneficial effects in sustaining attention have also been shown to be mediated by alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activity [A177550]. Clinical findings have shown that children with ADHD have an abnormality in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), the D4 receptor gene (DRD-4), and/or the D2 receptor gene that may be at least partly overcome by the dopaminergic effects of methylphenidate, suggesting a possible mode of action [F4474].

Methylphenidate contains a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. This abuse potential is likely related to the effects associated with higher doses of methylphenidate, which induce surface expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT) [A177553]. In particular, increased dopamine in key brain areas is associated with the reinforcing and addictive properties of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, and even amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of other drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, making ADHD sufferers more susceptible to their addictive effects[A177556]. Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DAT and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including [DB00289] and [DB01018].","113-45-1","207ZZ9QZ49",233.3062,233.141578857,"solid",2,11,0,1,NA,"Methylphenidate is indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in patients 6 years of age and older and for the treatment of narcolepsy.","Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the d- and l-isomers.

Zolpidem improves sleep in patients with insomnia. It is aimed for use in patients with difficulties initiating sleep. This drug decreases the time to fall asleep (sleep latency), increases the duration of sleep, and decreases the number of awakenings during sleep in patients with temporary (transient) insomnia.  It is available in both immediate acting and extended release forms [FDA label], [F3802]. 

Its tolerability profile is favorable when administered according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with a low risk of drug withdrawal, drug dependence, and drug tolerance [A175426]. In addition, zolpidem improves sleep quality in patients suffering from chronic insomnia and can show mild muscle relaxant properties [L5584]. Research also shows that zolpidem is rapid and effective in restoring brain function for patients in a vegetative state following brain injury. This drug has the propensity to completely or partially reverse the abnormal metabolism of damaged brain cells after injury [L5584], [A175444].","82626-48-0","7K383OQI23",307.3895,307.168462309,"solid",1,13,0,3,"Markus Sauter, ""Process for preparing zolpidem.""

This drug has CNS depressant effects, which may include somnolence, decreased alertness, sedation, drowsiness, dizziness,  and other changes in psychomotor function [FDA label].  Due to the above effects, the FDA has recommended an initial dose of zolpidem (immediate-acting) is a single dose of 5 mg for women and a single dose of 5 or 10 mg for men, immediately before bedtime with at least 7-8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening [L5581]. Refer to product labeling for detailed information [F3802], [FDA label]. 

**Effects on memory**

Controlled studies in adults using objective measures of memory demonstrated no significant evidence of next-day memory impairment after the administration of zolpidem. On the contrary, in a clinical study involving the administration of zolpidem doses of 10 and 20 mg, a  marked reduction in a next-morning recall of information relayed to subjects during peak drug effect (90 minutes after dosing) was observed. These subjects experienced a condition known as _anterograde amnesia_. Subjective evidence from adverse event data has suggested that anterograde amnesia may occur after zolpidem administration, mainly at doses above 10 mg [FDA label].

**Effects on psychomotor function**

This drug may cause decreased psychomotor performance. Additive psychomotor effects may occur with other drugs that cause depression of psychomotor function, including alcohol [FDA label]. Patients taking zolpidem should be cautioned against participating in hazardous activities or occupations requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination, including operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after ingesting the drug. Potential impairment of the performance of the above types of activities may also occur the day after zolpidem ingestion, especially at higher doses and ingestion of the extended-release form [FDA label], [F3802]. 

**Effects on insomnia and sleep stages**

Evidence suggests that this drug is associated with minimal rebound insomnia. During clinical trials with patients using zolpidem on an ‘as-needed’ basis, zolpidem use resulted in global improvements in sleep [A175426]. Zolpidem has been demonstrated to decrease sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep) for up to 35 days in controlled clinical studies [FDA label]. In studies measuring the percentage of sleep time spent in each sleep stage, zolpidem has primarily been shown to preserve sleep stages. Sleep time spent in stages 3 and 4 (deep sleep) was measured as similar to placebo with only minor and inconsistent changes in REM (paradoxical) sleep at the recommended dose [FDA label].

**Next-day residual effects**

 In 2013, the FDA issued a statement warning that patients who take zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR)<U+2015>either 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg<U+2015>should not drive or participate in other activities requiring full mental alertness the day after taking the drug, due to the fact that zolpidem concentrations can remain increased the next day, and impair the ability to perform these activities [L5581], [F3802].  Patients may decrease their risk of next-morning impairment by taking the lowest dose of their insomnia medicine that treats their symptoms, according to the FDA [L5590]. Specific dosing recommendations for both men and women are included in this statement [L5581]. This information is also available on product labeling [F3802], [FDA label]. 

**Rebound effects**

 There was no polysomnographic (objective) evidence of rebound insomnia at normal doses,  in studies evaluating sleep on the nights following discontinuation of zolpidem tartrate. Subjective evidence of impaired sleep in the elderly on the first post-treatment night was observed at doses higher than the recommended 5mg dose for elderly patients [FDA label].","
Zolpidem, the active moiety of zolpidem tartrate, is a hypnotic substance with a chemical structure that is not related to the structure benzodiazepines, barbiturates, pyrrolopyrazines, pyrazolopyrimidines or other drugs exerting hypnotic effects. It interacts with a _GABA-BZ_ receptor complex and shares various pharmacological properties with the _benzodiazepine_ class of drugs [FDA label].

Subunit binding of the _GABAA_ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex is thought to lead to the sedative, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and myorelaxant drug effects of zolpidem. The main regulatory site of the GABAA receptor complex can be found on its _alpha (a) subunit_ and is called the _benzodiazepine_ (BZ) or _omega (<U+03C9>)_ receptor. At least three different subtypes of the (<U+03C9>) receptor have been identified to this date [FDA label].

In contrast to benzodiazepine drugs, which are found to modulate all benzodiazepine receptor subtypes in a non-selective fashion, zolpidem binds the (BZ1) receptor specifically with a potent affinity for the alpha 1/alpha 5 subunits (in vitro) [FDA label].   More recent studies suggest that zolpidem binds primarily to the alpha 1, 2, and 3 subunits of the GABA receptor [A173896], [A10523], [A175567], and not the alpha 5 subunit. 

The (_BZ1_) receptor is found primarily on the Lamina IV of the brain sensorimotor cortical regions, substantia nigra (pars reticulata), cerebellum molecular layer, olfactory bulb, ventral thalamic complex, pons, inferior colliculus, and globus pallidus. Specific and selective binding of zolpidem on the (BZ1) receptor is not considered absolute, however, this binding could potentially explain the relative lack of myorelaxant and anticonvulsant activity in animal studies in addition to the preservation of deep sleep (stages 3 and 4) in human studies of zolpidem at hypnotic doses [FDA label].","
Zolpidem is metabolized to three pharmacologically by various hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes, mainly CYP3A4, but also CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 [A175429], [A175447].
Although zolpidem is heavily metabolized, all three metabolites are inactive [A175426]. 

The major metabolic routes in humans are oxidation of the methyl group on the phenyl ring or the methyl group on the imidazopyridine moiety, to produce carboxylic acids (metabolites I and II), and hydroxylation of one of the imidazopyridine groups (to produce metabolite X). Another less common pathway is by the oxidation of the methyl groups on the substituted amide [A175429].","Zolpidem is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In a single-dose crossover study in 45 healthy subjects given 5 and 10 mg zolpidem tartrate tablets, the average peak zolpidem concentrations (Cmax) were 59 and 121 ng/mL, respectively, occurring at a mean time (Tmax) of 1.6 hours for both doses [FDA label].","The average zolpidem elimination half-life was 2.6 and 2.5 hours, for the 5 and 10 mg tablets, respectively [FDA label].","92.5 ± 0.1% [FDA label]","Zolpidem tartrate tablets are converted to inactive metabolites that are eliminated mainly by renal excretion [FDA label].","0.54 to 0.68 L/kg (in humans) [A175429].

**Overdose**

Symptoms of overdose include impairment of consciousness ranging from somnolence to light coma, in addition to cardiorespiratory collapse resulting in fatal outcomes have been reported [FDA label].

**Withdrawal effects**

Following rapid decreases in dose or abrupt discontinuation of zolpidem and other sedative/hypnotics, reports of signs and symptoms similar to those associated with withdrawal from other CNS-depressant drugs have been made [FDA label]. 

**Carcinogenesis**

Zolpidem was administered to rats and mice over a span of 2 years at dietary dosages of 4, 18, and 80 mg/kg/day. In mice, these doses are considered 26 to 520 times or 2 to 35 times the maximum 10 mg human dose, respectively. In rats, these doses are 43 to 876 times or 6 to 115 times the maximum 10 mg human dose. No evidence of carcinogenicity was seen in mice. Renal liposarcomas were observed in 4/100 rats (3 males, 1 female) receiving 80 mg/kg/day, and a renal lipoma was observed in one male rat at the 18 mg/kg/day dose. Incidence rates of lipoma and liposarcoma for zolpidem were similar to those seen in historical control cases, and the tumor findings are presumed to be a spontaneous occurrence, not causally related to zolpidem [FDA label].

**Mutagenesis**

Zolpidem did not show mutagenic activity in several tests including the Ames test, genotoxicity in mouse lymphoma cells in vitro, chromosomal aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes, abnormal DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes in vitro, and the micronucleus test performed in mice [FDA label].

**Impairment of fertility**

In a rat reproduction study, the high dose (100 mg base/kg) of zolpidem lead to irregular estrus cycles and prolonged precoital intervals, however, there was no effect on male or female fertility after daily oral doses comparable to 5 to 130 times the recommended human dose. No effects on any other fertility parameters were observed [FDA label]. 

**Use in pregnancy**

This drug is considered a pregnancy category C drug.  There are currently no sufficient conclusive studies completed in pregnant women to determine the safety of zolpidem use during pregnancy. Zolpidem should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.

**Use in nursing**

From 0.004% to 0.019% of the total administered zolpidem dose is excreted into milk. The effect of zolpidem on the nursing infant is unknown at this time. Caution should be observed when zolpidem is administered to a nursing mother [FDA label]."

It is an active antiviral agent in ophthalmic solutions used mainly in the treatment of primary keratoconjunctivitis and recurrent epithelial keratitis due to herpes simplex virus. It displays effective antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 [A35271]. 

The combination product of trifluridine with tipiracil marketed as Lonsurf has been approved in Japan, the United States, and the European Union for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF biological therapy, and if RAS wild-type, an anti-EGFR therapy. In the anticancer therapy, trifluridine acts as a thymidine-based nucleoside metabolic inhibitor that gets incorporated into DNA of cancer cells following cell uptake to aberrate DNA function during cell replication [F649].","70-00-8","RMW9V5RW38",296.1999,296.062006087,"solid",2,4,0,0,NA,"Trifluridine is used for the treatment of primay keratoconjunctivitis and recurrent epithelial keratitis due to herpes simplex virus, types 1 and 2 in ophthalmic solutions.

Trifluridine, in combination with tipiracil as oral tablets, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF biological therapy, and if RAS wild-type, an anti-EGFR therapy [FDA Label].","Trifluridine exhibits an antiviral effect against herpes simplex virus, types 1 and 2 and vacciniavirus both in vitro and in vivo [A35271]. Some strains of adenovirus that contribute to the pathology of keratoconjunctivitis were shown to be susceptible to trifluridine _in vitro_ [A35271]. While there is evidence from a study that cross-resistance may develop between trifluridine and [idoxuridine] or [vidarabine], trifluridine was shown to effective in treating dendritic ulcers in patients with herpetic keratitis who are unresponsive to [idoxuridine] or [vidarabine] based on the results from masked comparative trials [A35271]. In nonclinical studies, trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride demonstrated antitumour activity against both 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) sensitive and resistant colorectal cancer cell lines [F649]. The cytotoxic activity of trifluridine and tipiracil against several human tumour xenografts show high correlation with the amount of trifluridine incorporated into DNA, indicating that the primary mechanism of action of trifluridine involves the direct incorporation into the cancer cell DNA [F649]. Trifluridine and tipiracil demonstrated anti-tumor activity against KRAS wild-type and mutant human colorectal cancer xenografts in mice [FDA Label]. 

In clinical studies comprised of patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer, treatment of trifluridine in combination with tipiracil in addition to best supportive care over a 5- or 7-month period resulted in increased progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) compared to placebo [F649]. In an open-label study, administration of trifluridine at the recommended dosage in patients with advanced solid tumors had no clinically relevant effect on QT/QTc prolongation compared with placebo [FDA Label]. Two out of 48 patients displayed had QTc greater than 500 msec and 1 of 42 patients (2.4%) had a QTc increase from baseline greater than 60 msec [FDA Label].","The mechanism of action of trifluridine as an antiviral agent has not been fully elucidated, but appears to involve the inhibition of viral replication. Trifluridine gets incorporated into viral DNA during replication, which leads to the formation of defective proteins and an increased mutation rate. Trifluridine also mediates antineoplastic activities via this mechanism; following uptake into cancer cells, trifluridine is rapidly phosphorylated by thymidine kinase to its active monophosphate form [A35272]. Subsequent phosphorylation produces trifluridine triphosphate [A35272], which is readily incorporated into the DNA of tumour cells in place of thymidine bases to perturb DNA function, DNA synthesis, and tumour cell proliferation [FDA Label]. As trifluridine is subject to rapid degradation by TPase and readily metabolised by a first-pass effect following oral administration, tipiracil is added in the antineoplastic combination product as an inhibitor of TPase to increase the bioavailability of trifluridine [F649]. Trifluridine monophosphate also reversibly inhibits thymidylate synthetase (TS), an enzyme that is necessary for DNA synthesis and which levels are shown to be elevated different cancer cell lines [A35289]. Up-regulation of the expression of the TS enzyme may also lead to the resistance to antineoplastic therapies, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) [A35289]. However, this inhibitory effect is not considered to be sufficient enough to fully contribute to the cytotoxicity in cancer cells [A35272].","One major metabolite, 5-carboxy-2'-deoxyuridine found on the endothelial side of the cornea, indicating localized metabolism [A35307, F658].

Trifluridine is mainly eliminated by metabolism via thymidine phosphorylase (TPase) to form an inactive metabolite, 5-(trifluoromethyl) uracil (FTY) [FDA Label].","Systemic absorption of trifluridine following therapeutic dosing with ophthalmic trifluridine appears to be negligible [F658]. 

At least 57% of the orally-administered trifluridine is absorbed [F649]. Following twice daily oral dosing of trifluridine in combination with tipiracil, systemic exposure of trifluridine increased more than dose-proportionally over the dose range of 15 to 35 mg/m^2. Trifluridine accumulation was 3-fold for AUC0-last and 2-fold for peak plasma concentration (Cmax) at steady state [FDA Label]. The time to reach the peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) was 2 hours [FDA Label]. Tipiracil increases the AUC and Cmax of trifluridine. Food intake was shown to decrease the Cmax and AUC compared to those in a fasting state [F649].","The half life is 12 to 18 minutes following ophthalmic administration [F658].

After administration of trifluridine with tipiracil at oral doses 35 mg/m^2 twice daily, the mean elimination half-life (t1/2) of trifluridine was 1.4 hours following a single dose [FDA Label]. At steady state, the mean elimination half-life was 2.1 hours [FDA Label].","_In vitro_ findings suggest that the protein binding of trifluridine in human plasma is greater than 96%, where it is mainly bound to human serum albumin.

It displays anti-anxiety effects as well.[L6640] Compared to other phenothiazine derivatives, prochlorperazine is less sedating and has a weak propensity for causing hypotension or potentiating the effects of CNS depressants and anesthetics.[L6646] Other than its primary action on D2 receptors, one study showed that prochlorperazine may inhibit the P2X7 receptor in human macrophages, leading to inhibition of calcium ion influx.[L6637]","The mechanism of action of prochlorperazine has not been fully determined, but may be primarily related to its anti-dopaminergic effects. Prochlorperazine blocks the D2 dopamine receptors in the brain, which are somatodendritic autoreceptors. Inhibition of D2 receptor signaling results in the blockade of postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the mesolimbic system [L6643] and an increased dopamine turnover. Nausea and vomiting are proposed to arise from peripheral or central stimulation of  serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) and dopamine type 2 receptors, the predominant receptors expressed at the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ).[A179194,L6643] Prochlorperazine exerts antiemetic effects and was shown to inhibit apomorphine-induced vomiting by blocking D2 dopamine receptors in the CTZ.[A179179].","Prochlorperazine undergoes hepatic metabolism involving oxidation, hydroxylation, demethylation, sulfoxide formation and conjugation with glucuronic acid.[L6649] The oxidation reaction is mediated by CYP2D6.[A179179] N-desmethyl prochlorperazine was detected in the plasma[A179173], as well as prochlorperazine sulfoxide, prochlorperazine 7-hydroxide and prochlorperazine sulfoxide 4'-N-oxide, following oral and buccal administration.[A179188] Prochlorperazine may enter the enterohepatic circulation.[L6646]","Following oral administration, prochlorperazine is reported to be well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.

Oral LD<sub>50</sub> in rats is 750 mg/kg. Intraperitoneal and subcutaneous LD<sub>50</sub> in mice are 191 mg/kg and 320 mg/kg, respectively.[MSDS] In placebo-controlled trials, there were increased incidences of mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis receiving antipsychotic medications. The risk of death in drug-treated patients was about 1.6 to 1.7 times that of placebo-treated patients. Deaths were largely resulting from cardiovascular, such as heart failure and sudden death, or infectious, such as pneumonia, conditions.[label] Due to its antagonist action on dopamine receptors, prochlorperazine is associated with a risk for developing extrapyramidal symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia, which is a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. This risk is also conferred on other antipsychotic agents that block dopamine receptors. It is proposed that increased duration of the drug treatment is likely thus increased total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient leads to increased risk for developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible. As with other antipsychotic agents, prochlorperazine is associated with a risk for causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which is a potentially fatal symptom complex, which is manifested as hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability. 

There is no known antidote for prochlorperazine thus overdose treatment should be supportive and symptomatic. Overdose of prochlorperazine may produce dystonic reactions that involve extrapyramidal mechanism. To reduce these symptoms, antiparkinsonism drugs, barbiturates, or diphenhydramine may be used. Symptoms of central nervous system depression, such as somnolence or coma, may also be observed. Amphetamine, destroamphetamine, or caffeine and sodium benzoate may be used to induce stimulatory effects. In contrast, agitation and restlessness may also be seen in case of overdose. Other possible manifestations include convulsions, EKG changes and cardiac arrhythmias, fever, and autonomic reactions such as hypotension, dry mouth and ileus. Hypotension can be responded with the standard measures for managing circulatory shock.[label] 

**Nonclinical Toxicology**

In a rat developmental or reproductive toxicity study, abnormalities in both the reproductive measures and neurobehavioral testing were observed following administration of 25 mg/kg of prochlorperazine.[L6649] 

**Use in specific populations**

As the use of antipsychotic agents during the third trimester of pregnancy is associated with a risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery, the use of prochlorperazine in pregnant patients is generally not recommended and it should be limited after careful consideration of the potential benefit of drug therapy justifying the potential risk to the fetus. Caution should be exercised when prochlorperazine is administered to a nursing mother. While lower doses of prochlorperazine is reported to be safe for elderly patients, caution is still advised, especially those with higher susceptibility to hypotension and neuromuscular reactions.[label]"

Nitric oxide appears to increase the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) by dilating pulmonary vessels in better entilated areas of the lung, redistributing pulmonary blood flow away from lung regions with low ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratios toward regions with normal ratios.","Nitric oxide is a compound produced by many cells of the body.

This disease has been well-documented in historical medical records and appears in the biographies of several prominent, historically recognized individuals [A175942].

Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase enzyme inhibitor that is considered to be one of the most effective drugs used to decrease urate levels and is frequently used in the treatment of chronic gout [A36705]. It was initially approved by the FDA in 1966 [L5674] and is now formulated by several manufacturers [L5677].","315-30-0","63CZ7GJN5I",136.1115,136.03851077,"solid",1,10,1,2,"Druey, J. and Schmidt, P.; US.

3) the management of patients with recurrent calcium oxalate calculi whose daily uric acid excretion exceeds 800 mg/day in male patients and 750 mg/day in female patients. Therapy in such patients should be carefully assessed initially and reassessed periodically to determine in each case that treatment is beneficial and that the benefits outweigh the risks.","
Allopurinol decreases the production of uric acid by stopping the biochemical reactions that precede its formation [FDA label].  This process decreases urate and relieves the symptoms of gout, which may include painful tophi, joint pain, inflammation, redness, decreased range of motion, and swelling [A665].

","Allopurinol is a structural analog of the natural purine base, hypoxanthine.  After ingestion, allopurinol is metabolized to its active metabolite, oxypurinol (_alloxanthine_) in the liver [T508], which acts as an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase enzyme [FDA label]. 

Allopurinol and its active metabolite inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that converts hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Inhibition of this enzyme is responsible for the effects of allopurinol. This drug increases the reutilization of hypoxanthine and xanthine for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis by a process that involves the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase).  This process results in an increased nucleotide concentration, which causes feedback inhibition of de novo purine synthesis. The end result is decreased urine and serum uric acid concentrations [F3988], which decreases the incidence of gout symptoms. 

Accompanying the reduction of serum uric acid by allopurinol is an increase in the serum and urine concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine (due to inhibition of xanthine oxidase).  In the absence of allopurinol, regular urinary excretion of oxypurines almost entirely occurs in the form of uric acid. After the ingestion of allopurinol, the contents of excreted urine are hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid. Because each substance has its own individual solubility, the concentration of uric acid in plasma is decreased without exposing the renal tissues to a high load of uric acid, thereby decreasing the risk of crystalluria. By lowering the uric acid concentration in the plasma below its limits of solubility, allopurinol encourages the dissolution of gout tophi. Although the levels of hypoxanthine and xanthine are found to be increased after allopurinol ingestion, the risk of deposition in renal tissues is less than that of uric acid, as they become more soluble and are rapidly excreted by the kidney [F3988].","Allopurinol is rapidly metabolized to the corresponding xanthine analog, oxipurinol (alloxanthine), which is also an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase enzyme [FDA label]. 
Both allopurinol and oxypurinol inhibit the action of this enzyme. Allopurinol and oxypurinol are also converted by the purine salvage pathway to their respective ribonucleotides. The effect of these ribonucleotides related to the hypouricemic action of allopurinol in humans is not fully elucidated to this date. These metabolites may act to inhibit de novo purine biosynthesis by inhibiting the enzyme, _amidophosphoribosyltransferase_. The ribonucleotides have not been found to be incorporated in DNA [A175945].
","This drug is about 90% absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak plasma levels normally occur at 1.5 hours and 4.5 hours post-dose for allopurinol and oxipurinol respectively. Following one oral dose of 300 mg of allopurinol, maximum plasma levels of about 3 mcg/mL of allopurinol and 6.5 mcg/mL of oxipurinol were measured [FDA label].","The plasma half-life of allopurinol is 1-2 hours, due to its rapid renal clearance [FDA label].","Allopurinol and oxypurinol are only negligibly bound to plasma proteins [A175954, A175948].","Approximately 80% of orally ingested allopurinol is found excreted in the urine as various metabolites [A175948]. About 20% of ingested allopurinol is excreted in the feces [FDA label].","Allopurinol and oxypurinol are both substrates for the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which is present in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells of capillaries, including sinusoids, with the highest activity demonstrated in the liver and intestinal lining. Tissue concentrations of allopurinol have not yet been reported in humans, however, it is probable that allopurinol and the metabolite oxypurinol would be measured in the highest concentrations in the abovementioned tissues. In animals, allopurinol concentrations are found to reach the highest levels in the blood, liver, intestine and heart, and lowest in the brain and lung tissues [A175948].","Since allopurinol and its metabolites are mainly eliminated by the kidney, accumulation of this drug can occur in patients with renal dysfunction or failure, and the dose of allopurinol should, therefore, be reduced. With a creatinine clearance of 10 to 20 mL/min, a daily dosage of 200 mg of allopurinol is suitable. When the creatinine clearance is less than 10 mL/min, the daily dosage should not be higher than 100 mg. With severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance measured at less than 3 mL/min) a longer interval between doses may be required [FDA label].","AdenockTanabeAllohexalAllorilAluronMiluritProgoutZyloricZyrik",0,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00437.pdf?1552940749","//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00437.pdf?1265922739",3,1016,"**Oral TDLO** (rat): 10 mg/kg; **Oral LD50** (mouse): 78 mg/kg; **Oral TDLO (mouse)**: 100 mg/kg [F3985] 

**Use in pregnancy**

Reproductive studies have been completed using rats and rabbit models at doses up to twenty times the normal human dose ( about 5 mg/kg per day), and it was concluded that fertility was not impaired and there was no fetal harm. There is a published report of a study in pregnant mice administered 50 or 100 mg/kg allopurinol intraperitoneally on gestation days 10 or 13. There were increased numbers of dead fetuses in dams administered 100 mg/kg allopurinol, however, death did not occur in those given 50 mg/kg. There were higher numbers of external malformations in fetuses at both doses of allopurinol on gestation day 10 and higher numbers of skeletal malformations in fetuses at both doses on gestation day 13. Despite the above findings, there are no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if it is absolutely required [FDA label]. 

**Use in nursing**

Both allopurinol and the metabolite oxipurinol have been found in the milk of a mother who was receiving allopurinol. Since the effect of allopurinol on the nursing infant is unknown, it is advisable to exercise caution when allopurinol is taken by a nursing woman [FDA label]. 

**Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity**

Cytogenic studies demonstrate that allopurinol does not induce chromosomal abnormalities in human blood cells in vitro at concentrations up to 100 g/mL and in vivo at doses up to 60 mg/day for an average duration of 40 months. Allopurinol does not form nitroso compounds (which may be carcinogenic) or affect lymphocyte transformation in vitro. Evidence suggests that allopurinol does not have deleterious effects on DNA at any stage of the cell cycle and was not found to be mutagenic. No evidence of carcinogenicity has been observed in mice treated with allopurinol for up to a 2 year period [F3988]."

General properties of drugs in this class include: interaction with DNA in a variety of different ways including intercalation (squeezing between the base pairs), DNA strand breakage and inhibition with the enzyme topoisomerase II. Most of these compounds have been isolated from natural sources and antibiotics. However, they lack the specificity of the antimicrobial antibiotics and thus produce significant toxicity. The anthracyclines are among the most important antitumor drugs available. Doxorubicin is widely used for the treatment of several solid tumors while daunorubicin and idarubicin are used exclusively for the treatment of leukemia. Epirubicin may also inhibit polymerase activity, affect regulation of gene expression, and produce free radical damage to DNA. Epirubicin possesses an antitumor effect against a wide spectrum of tumors, either grafted or spontaneous. The anthracyclines are cell cycle-nonspecific.","Epirubicin has antimitotic and cytotoxic activity. It inhibits nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis through a number of proposed mechanisms of action: Epirubicin forms complexes with DNA by intercalation between base pairs, and it inhibits topoisomerase II activity by stabilizing the DNA-topoisomerase II complex, preventing the religation portion of the ligation-religation reaction that topoisomerase II catalyzes. It also interferes with DNA replication and transcription by inhibiting DNA helicase activity.","Extensively and rapidly metabolized in the liver. Epirubicin is also metabolized by other organs and cells, including red blood cells.

The thyroid hormones have been shown to exert both genomic and non-genomic effects.[A179950] They exert their genomic effects by diffusing into the cell nucleus and binding to thyroid hormone receptors in DNA regions called thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) near genes.[A179605]  This complex of T<sub>4</sub>, T<sub>3</sub>, DNA, and other coregulatory proteins causes a conformational change and a resulting shift in transcriptional regulation of nearby genes, synthesis of messenger RNA, and cytoplasmic protein production.[A179605,A179935] For example, in cardiac tissues T<sub>3</sub> has been shown to regulate the genes for a- and ß-myosin heavy chains, production of the sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins calcium-activated ATPase (Ca2+-ATPase) and phospholamban, ß-adrenergic receptors, guanine-nucleotide regulatory proteins, and adenylyl cyclase types V and VI as well as several plasma-membrane ion transporters, such as Na+/K+–ATPase, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, and voltage-gated potassium channels, including Kv1.5, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3. [A179938] As a result, many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status.","51-48-9","Q51BO43MG4",776.87,776.686681525,"solid",1,9,0,0,"Jivn-Ren Chen, Dimitri C.

It is also indicated as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy in the management of thyrotropin-dependent well-differentiated thyroid cancer.","Oral levothyroxine is a synthetic hormone that exerts the same physiologic effect as endogenous T<sub>4</sub>, thereby maintaining normal T<sub>4</sub> levels when a deficiency is present. 

Levothyroxine has a narrow therapeutic index and is titrated to maintain a euthyroid state with TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) within a therapeutic range of 0.45–4.5 mIU/L. Over- or undertreatment with levothyroxine may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function and glucose and lipid metabolism. The dose of levothyroxine should be titrated slowly and carefully and patients should be monitored for their response to titration to avoid these effects. TSH levels should be monitored at least yearly to avoid over-treating with levothyroxine which can result in hyperthyroidism (TSH <0.1mIU/L) and symptoms of increased heart rate, diarrhea, tremor, hypercalcemia, and weakness to name a few.[F4636]

As many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status,[A179938] over-treatment with levothyroxine may result in increases in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. In populations with any cardiac concerns, levothyroxine should be initiated at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease. Patients receiving concomitant levothyroxine and sympathomimetic agents should be monitored for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiac symptoms develop or worsen, reduce the levothyroxine dose or withhold for one week and restart at a lower dose.[F4636]

Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of levothyroxine over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of levothyroxine that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate this risk.

Addition of levothyroxine therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing or discontinuing levothyroxine.","Levothyroxine is a synthetically prepared levo-isomer of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>, a tetra-iodinated tyrosine derivative) that acts as a replacement in deficiency syndromes such as hypothyroidism. T<sub>4</sub> is the major hormone secreted from the thyroid gland and is chemically identical to the naturally secreted T<sub>4</sub>: it increases metabolic rate, decreases thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) production from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, and, in peripheral tissues, is converted to T<sub>3</sub>. Thyroxine is released from its precursor protein thyroglobulin through proteolysis and secreted into the blood where is it then peripherally deiodinated to form triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) which exerts a broad spectrum of stimulatory effects on cell metabolism. T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> have a relative potency of ~1:4. 

Thyroid hormone increases the metabolic rate of cells of all tissues in the body. In the fetus and newborn, thyroid hormone is important for the growth and development of all tissues including bones and the brain. In adults, thyroid hormone helps to maintain brain function, food metabolism, and body temperature, among other effects. The symptoms of thyroid deficiency relieved by levothyroxine include slow speech, lack of energy, weight gain, hair loss, dry thick skin and unusual sensitivity to cold.

The thyroid hormones have been shown to exert both genomic and non-genomic effects.[A179950] They exert their genomic effects by diffusing into the cell nucleus and binding to thyroid hormone receptors in DNA regions called thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) near genes.[A179605] This complex of T<sub>4</sub>, T<sub>3</sub>, DNA, and other coregulatory proteins causes a conformational change and a resulting shift in transcriptional regulation of nearby genes, synthesis of messenger RNA, and cytoplasmic protein production.[A179605,A179935] For example, in cardiac tissues T<sub>3</sub> has been shown to regulate the genes for a- and ß-myosin heavy chains, production of the sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins calcium-activated ATPase (Ca2+-ATPase) and phospholamban, ß-adrenergic receptors, guanine-nucleotide regulatory proteins, and adenylyl cyclase types V and VI as well as several plasma-membrane ion transporters, such as Na+/K+–ATPase, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, and voltage-gated potassium channels, including Kv1.5, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3. [A179938] As a result, many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status.","Approximately 70% of secreted T<sub>4</sub> is deiodinated to equal amounts of T<sub>3</sub> and reverse triiodothyronine (rT<sub>3</sub>), which is calorigenically inactive. T<sub>4</sub> is slowly eliminated through its major metabolic pathway to T<sub>3</sub> via sequential deiodination, where approximately 80% of circulating T<sub>3</sub> is derived from peripheral T<sub>4</sub>. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>, with T<sub>4</sub> deiodination also occurring at a number of additional sites, including the kidney and other tissues.

Elimination of T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> involves hepatic conjugation to glucuronic and sulfuric acids. The hormones undergo enterohepatic circulation as conjugates are hydrolyzed in the intestine and reabsorbed. Conjugated compounds that reach the colon are hydrolyzed and eliminated as free compounds in the feces. Other minor T<sub>4</sub> metabolites have been identified.","Absorption of orally administered T4 from the gastrointestinal tract ranges from 40% to 80%. The majority of the levothyroxine sodium tablets dose is absorbed from the jejunum and upper ileum. T4 absorption is increased by fasting, and decreased in malabsorption syndromes and by certain foods such as soybeans, milk, and dietary fiber. Absorption may also decrease with age. In addition, many drugs affect T4 absorption including bile acide sequestrants, sucralfate, proton pump inhibitors, and minerals such as calcium (including in yogurt and milk products)[A179617], magnesium, iron, and aluminum supplements. To prevent the formation of insoluble chelates, levothyroxine should generally be taken on an empty stomach at least 2 hours before a meal and separated by at least 4 hours from any interacting agents.","T<sub>4</sub>, 6 to 7 days. T<sub>3</sub>, 1 to 2 days.","Circulating thyroid hormones are greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins, including thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine-binding prealbumin (TBPA) and albumin (TBA). The higher affinity of both TBG and TBPA for T4 partially explains the higher serum levels, slower metabolic clearance and longer half-life of T4 compared to T3. Protein-bound thyroid hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with small amounts of free hormone where only unbound hormone is metabolically active.","Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys.

Meperidine may produce less smooth muscle spasm, constipation, and depression of the cough reflex than equivalent doses of morphine. The onset of action is lightly more rapid than with morphine, and the duration of action is slightly shorter. The chemical structure of meperidine is similar to local anesthetics. Meperidine is recommended for relief of moderate to severe acute pain and has the unique ability to interrupt postoperative shivering and shaking chills induced by amphotericin B. Meperidine has also been used for intravenous regional anesthesia, peripheral nerve blocks and intraarticular, epidural and spinal analgesia. Meperidine is considered a second-line agent for the treatment of acute pain.","Meperidine is primarily a kappa-opiate receptor agonist and also has local anesthetic effects. Meperidine has more affinity for the kappa-receptor than morphine. Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability.","Meperidine is metabolized in the liver by hydrolysis to meperidinic acid followed by partial conjugation with glucuronic acid.

The decrease in blood pressure may occur in both standing and supine positions [FDA label]. 

Many of the above effects are due to vasodilation of blood vessels caused by prazosin, resulting in decreased peripheral resistance [A176627], [FDA label].  Peripheral resistance refers to the level resistance of the blood vessels to blood that flows through them. As the blood vessels constrict (narrow), the resistance increases and as they dilate (widen), and peripheral resistance decreases, lowering blood pressure [A176747, L5831].  

**Effects on sleep disturbance related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**

Some studies have suggested that this drug improves sleep in patients suffering from insomnia related to nightmares and post-traumatic stress disorder, caused by hyperarousal [A176621, A176624]. This effect likely occurs through the inhibition of adrenergic stimulation found in states of hyperarousal [A176738].","Alpha-adrenergic receptors are essential for the regulation of blood pressure in humans. Two types of alpha receptors, alpha 1 and alpha 2, both play a role in regulating blood pressure.  Alpha-1 receptors are postsynaptic (located after the nerve junction, or space between a nerve fiber and target tissue). In this case, the target tissue is the vascular smooth muscle [L5837].  These receptors, when activated, increase blood pressure [A176648]. 

Prazosin inhibits the postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenoceptors. This inhibition blocks the vasoconstricting (narrowing) effect of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) on the vessels, leading to peripheral blood vessel dilation.  Through blood vessel constriction by adrenergic receptor activation, epinephrine and norepinephrine normally act to increase blood pressure [A176654].

TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, imipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, imipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Tertiary amine TCAs, such as imipramine and amitriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake than secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline and desipramine. TCAs also block histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively [A6584]. Imipramine has less sedative and anticholinergic effects than the tertiary amine TCAs, amitriptyline and clomipramine. Imipramine may be used to treat depression and nocturnal enuresis in children [FDA Label]. Unlabeled indications include chronic and neuropathic pain (including diabetic neuropathy), panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [L1349,L1348,A31900,L1351,L1352,L1353,A31904].","50-49-7","OGG85SX4E4",280.4073,280.193948778,"solid",1,9,1,6,"U.S. Patent 2,554,736.","For the relief of symptoms of depression and as temporary adjunctive therapy in reducing enuresis in children aged 6 years and older [FDA Label].

While it acts to block both, imipramine displays a much higher affinity for the serotonin reuptake transporter than for the norepinephrine reuptake transporter [A6584]. Imipramine produces effects similar to other monoamine targeting antidepressants, increasing serotonin- and norepinephrine-based neurotransmission.

This modulation of neurotransmission produces a complex range of changes in brain structure and function along with an improvement in depressive symptoms. The changes include increases in hippocampal neurogenesis and reduced downregulation of this neurogenesis in response to stress [A31931]. These implicate brain derived neurotrophic factor signalling as a necessary contributor to antidepressant effect although the link to the direct increase in monoamine neurotransmission is unclear.

Serotonin reuptake targeting agents may also produce a down-regulation in ß-adrenergic receptors in the brain [A31938].","Imipramine works by inhibiting the neuronal reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin [A6584,T116]. It binds the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter and sodium-dependent norepinephrine transporter reducing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin by neurons. Depression has been linked to a lack of stimulation of the post-synaptic neuron by norepinephrine and serotonin [A31933]. Slowing the reuptake of these neurotransmitters increases their concentration in the synaptic cleft, producing knock-on effects in protein kinase signalling which is thought to contribute to changes in neurotransmission and brain physiology which relieves symptoms of depression [A31939].","Imipramine is nearly exclusively metabolized by the liver [A31907]. Imipramine is converted to desipramine by CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C19. Both imipramine and desipramine are hydroxylated by CYP2D6 [A31915]. Desipramine is an active metabolite.

Minor metabolic pathways include dealkylation to form an imidodibenzyl product as well as demethylation of desipramine to didemethylimipramine and subsequent hydroxylation [A31907].

1) Symptomatic relief in rheumatoid arthritis.

2) Symptomatic relief in osteoarthritis.","NSAIDs, like nabumetone, are well established as analgesics. NSAIDs reduce both peripheral and central sensitization of nociceptive neurons due to inflammation which contribute to hyperalgesia and allodynia.[T116,A179023] This sensitization occurs through reducing the action potential threshold in peripheral neurons, reducing the intensity of painful stimuli needed to produce a painful sensation. Centrally, activation of dorsal horn neurons occurs along with increased release of glutamate, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P which increase the transmission of painful stimuli. Coupled with this is an inhibition glycinergic neurons which normally inhibit pain transmission, a phenomenon known as disinhibition. Increased activity ofn-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) and a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors leads to the establishment of central sensitization, allowing both mild painful and innocuous stimuli to produce action potentials in nociceptive projection neurons. NSAIDs are effective in reducing mild-moderate acute and chronic nociceptive pain, however, the usefulness of NSAIDs in neuropathic pain is limited.

The anti-inflammatory effect of NSAIDs is mediated by preventing vasodilation, increases in vascular permeability, and the release of cytokines from endothelial cells.[T116,A179044] These three effects together prevent immunocompetent cells from migrating to the site of injury thereby preventing additional damage and inflammation due to activation of the immune system at the site of damage. PGs also modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation, an activity which is thought to be of importance in arthritic conditions.

The anti-pyretic effect of NSAIDs is mediated through preventing increases in temperature by prostaglandins (PGs) via the hypothalamus.[T116] Activation of this process by other inflammatory mediators relies upon subsequent action by PGs, therefore NSAIDs are able to reduce fever due to these mediators as well.

The adverse effects of NSAIDs are related to their therapeutic effects.[T116] The same vasodilatory action which occurs in inflammation also serves to regulate blood flow to the kidneys through the afferent renal arteries. NSAIDs are widely known as nephrotoxic agents as the reduction in PGs produces vasoconstriction of these arteries resulting in reduced blood flow to the kidneys and a subsequent decline in renal function. Reductions in mucus and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion in the stomach increases the risk of ulceration by limiting the protection mediated by PGs. Lastly, COX-2 selective agents like nabumetone can unbalance prothrombotic and antithrombotic prostanoid generation leading to increased platelet aggregation and increased risk of thrombosis.","Nabumetone's active metabolite, 6-MNA, is an inhibitor of both COX-1 and COX-2 although it exhibits some COX-2 selectivity.[label,A178903] Inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 reduces conversion of arachidonic acid to PGs and thromboxane (TXA<sub>2</sub>). This reduction in prostanoid production is the common mechanism that mediates the effects of nambutone.

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.

PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to ß adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.

PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

The adverse effects of NSAIDs stem from the protective and regulatory roles of prostanoids which have been well-characterized.[T116] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> regulate blood flow to the kidney by similar mechanisms to the vasodilation they produce in inflammation. Prevention of this regulation by NSAIDs produces vasoconstriction which limits renal function by reducing blood flow and the hydrostatic pressure which drives filtration. PGE<sub>2</sub> also regulates gastric protection via EP<sub>3</sub> receptors which are, in this location, coupled to G<sub>i</sub> which inhibits the AC/PKA pathway. This reduces the secretion of protons by H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase in parietal cells and increases the secretion of mucus and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> by superficial endothelial cells. Disruption of this protective action by NSAIDs lead to ulceration of the gastric mucosa. Lastly, disruption of PGI<sub>2</sub>, which opposes platelet aggregation, generation by COX-2 selective agents leads to an imbalance with TXA<sub>2</sub> generated by COX-1, which promotes aggregation of platelets, leading to increased risk of thrombosis. Since nabumetone is somewhat COX-2 selective it is thought to promote this imbalance and increase thrombotic risk.[A178903]","Nabumetone is reduced to 3-hydroxy nabumetone by the aldo-keto reductase-1C family and by corticosteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenase[A178897,A178900]. It then undergoes oxidative cleavage by CYP1A2 to 6-MNA, the active metabolite.[A17750,A178900] 6-MNA is eliminated by O-demethylation by CYP2C9 to 6-hydroxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6-HNA).[A178897,A178900] Both 6-MNA and 6-HNA are further converted to conjugates.[A178900] Other metabolites are generated through a mix of ketone reduction and O-demethylation along with subsequent conjugation.

[L6520]  Regardless of the etiology of pain, patients should use the lowest possible dose, and avoid using ketorolac for an extended period of time (ideally = 5 days).[L6526]  A benefit of choosing ketorolac over other analgesics with similar potency is that that there does not appear to be a risk of dependence or tolerance with ketorolac use.[A176131]","Ketorolac is a non-selective NSAID and acts by inhibiting both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes which are normally responsible for converting arachidonic acid to prostaglandins.  The COX-1 enzyme is constitutively active and can be found in platelets, gastric mucosa, and vascular endothelium.  On the other hand, the COX-2 enzyme is inducible and mediates inflammation, pain and fever.  

As a result, inhibition of the COX-1 enzyme is linked to an increased risk of bleeding and risk of gastric ulceration, while the desired anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties are linked to inhibition of the COX-2 enzyme.[A176134] Therefore, despite it's effectiveness in pain management, ketorolac should not be used long-term since this increases the risk of serious adverse effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcers, and perforations.[A178678]","Ketorolac inhibits key pathways in prostaglandin synthesis which is crucial to it's mechanism of action.[A176143]  Although ketorolac is non-selective and inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, it's clinical efficacy is derived from it's COX-2 inhibition.  The COX-2 enzyme is inducible and is responsible for converting arachidonic acid to prostaglandins that mediate inflammation and pain.  By blocking this pathway, ketorolac achieves analgesia and reduces inflammation.[A176134] Ketorolac is administered as a racemic mixture; however, the ""S"" enantiomer is largely responsible for it's pharmacological activity.[A176246]","Ketorolac is heavily metabolized via hydroxylation or conjugation in the liver; however, it appears that the key metabolic pathway is glucuronic acid conjugation.[L6526][A176143] Enzymes involved in phase I metabolism include CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, while phase II metabolism is carried out by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7.[A176234]","Ketorolac is rapidly, and completely absorbed after oral administration with a bioavailability of 80% after oral administration.[L6526][A176143] Cmax is attained 20-60 minutes after administration, and after intramuscular administration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) is proportional to the dose administered.[A175966]

THC demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, which results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. Due to its evidence as an appetite stimulant and an anti-nauseant, Dronabinol is approved for use in anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments [FDA Label].

Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Dronabinol or [DB00486]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.

From a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others [A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function [A32676].","1972-08-3","7J8897W37S",314.4617,314.224580204,"solid",2,4,0,0,"Fabio E.S.

Additionally, in patients who continue to experience asthma symptoms, montelukast can also be combined with an 'as required' short-acting beta-agonist, an inhaled corticosteroid, or inhaled corticosteroid paired with a long-acting beta-agonist.[L6304,L6328]","Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that demonstrates a marked affinity and selectivity to the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor type-1 in preference to many other crucial airway receptors like the prostanoid, cholinergic, or beta-adrenergic receptors.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] As a consequence, the agent can elicit substantial blockage of LTD4 leukotriene-mediated bronchoconstriction with doses as low as 5 mg.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Moreover, a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12) demonstrated that montelukast is capable of inhibiting early and late phase bronchoconstriction caused by antigen challenge by 75% and 57% respectively.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]

In particular, it has been documented that montelukast can cause bronchodilation as soon as within 2 hours of oral administration.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] This action can also be additive to the bronchodilation caused by the concomitant use of a beta agonist.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Nevertheless, clinical investigations performed with adults 15 years of age and older revealed that no additional clinical benefit is obtained when doses of montelukast greater than 10 mg a day are used.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]

Additionally, in clinical trials with adults and pediatric asthmatic patients aged 6 to 14 years, it was also determined that montelukast can reduce mean peripheral blood eosinophils by about 13% to 15% from baseline in comparison to placebo during double-blind treatment periods.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] At the same time, in patients aged 15 years and older who were experiencing seasonal allergic rhinitis, the use of montelukast caused a median reduction of 13% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts when compared to placebo as well.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]","Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT) like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, among others, are eicosanoids released by a variety of cells like mast cells and eosinophils.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] When such CysLT bind to corresponding CysLT receptors like CysLT type-1 receptors located on respiratory airway smooth muscle cells, airway macrophages, and on various pro-inflammatory cells like eosinophils and some specific myeloid stem cells activities that facilitate the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis are stimulated.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]

In particular, CysLT-mediated airway bronchoconstriction, occluding mucous secretion, vascular permeability, and eosinophil recruitment are all types of effects that facilitate asthma.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Alternatively, in allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released by the nasal mucosa when exposed to allergens during both early and late phase reactions and participate in eliciting symptoms of allergic rhinitis like a congested nose and airway.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]

Subsequently, montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT type 1 receptor, which consequently assists in inhibiting any physiological actions of CysLTs like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 at the receptor that may facilitate asthma or allergic rhinitis.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]","It has been determined that montelukast is highly metabolized and typically so by the cytochrome P450 3A4, 2C8, and 2C9 isoenzymes.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] In particular, it seems that the CYP2C8 enzymes play a significant role in the metabolism of the drug.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Nevertheless, at therapeutic doses, the plasma concentrations of montelukast metabolites are undetectable at steady state in adults and pediatric patients.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]","It has been observed that montelukast is quickly absorbed following administration by the oral route.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] The oral bioavailability documented for the drug is 64%.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Furthermore, it seems that having a regular meal in the morning or even a high fat snack in the evening does not affect the absorption of montelukast.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]","Studies have demonstrated that the mean plasma half-life of montelukast varies from 2.7 to 5.5 hours when observed in healthy young adults.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6325,L6328,L6331]","It has been determined that the protein binding of montelukast to plasma proteins exceeds 99%.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6325,L6328,L6331]","It has been reported that montelukast and its metabolites are almost exclusively excreted in the bile and into the feces.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]","The steady-state volume of distribution recorded for montelukast is an average between 8 to 11 litres.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6325,L6328,L6331]","The plasma clearance documented for montelukast is an average of 45 mL/min when observed in healthy adults.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6325,L6328,L6331]","LukotasMollyAllengeMonocastBeximcoMontefloMontelo-10MonteneSquareRespaireSanta-FarmaSurfairSandozTelumantesActavisVentekSearleVentilarGutisXalarUnimedZespiraBilim",1,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00471.pdf?1265922815","//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00471.pdf?1557766628",1,782,"The adverse effects associated with overdosage of montelukast include abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting, psychomotor hyperactivity, and less frequently, convulsion.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]

Fluoxetine is a racemic mixture of the R- and S- enantiomers and are of equivalent pharmacologic activity. Despite distinct structural differences between compounds in this class, SSRIs possess similar pharmacological activity. As with other antidepressant agents, several weeks of therapy may be required before a clinical effect is seen. SSRIs are potent inhibitors of neuronal serotonin reuptake. They have little to no effect on norepinephrine or dopamine reuptake and do not antagonize &alpha;- or &beta;-adrenergic, dopamine D<sub>2</sub> or histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors. During acute use, SSRIs block serotonin reuptake and increase serotonin stimulation of somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and terminal autoreceptors. Chronic use leads to desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and terminal autoreceptors. The overall clinical effect of increased mood and decreased anxiety is thought to be due to adaptive changes in neuronal function that leads to enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission. Side effects include dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, sexual dysfunction and headache. Side effects generally occur within the first two weeks of therapy and are usually less severe and frequent than those observed with tricyclic antidepressants. Fluoxetine may be used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), moderate to severe bulimia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, and in combination with olanzapine for treatment-resistant or bipolar I depression.

Unlabeled indications include: selective mutism, mild dementia-associated agitation in nonpsychotic patients, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety disorder, chronic neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and Raynaud's phenomenon.","Fluoxetine, an antidepressant agent belonging to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), is used to treat depression, bulimia nervosa, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, panic disorder and post-traumatic stress. According to the amines hypothesis, a functional decrease in the activity of amines, such as serotonin and norepinephrine, would result in depression; a functional increase of the activity of these amines would result in mood elevation. Fluoxetine's effects are thought to be associated with the inhibition of 5HT receptor, which leads to an increase of serotonin level. Antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and a1–adrenergic receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects of classical tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) drugs. Fluoxetine binds to these and other membrane receptors from brain tissue much less potently in vitro than do the tricyclic drugs.","Metabolized to norfluoxetine, fluoxetine is a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), it blocks the reuptake of serotonin at the serotonin reuptake pump of the neuronal membrane, enhancing the actions of serotonin on 5HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors.

Fluoxetine appears to be extensively metabolized, likely in the liver, to norfluoxetine and other metabolites. Norfluoxetine, the principal active metabolite, is formed via <i>N</i>-demethylation of fluoxetine. Norfluoxetine appears to be comparable pharmacologic potency as fluoxetine. Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine both undergo phase II glucuronidation reactions in the liver.

Increased contraction of this sphincter increases the pressure needed to produce an incontinence episode in stress urinary incontinence. Duloxetine has been shown to improve Patient Global Impression of Improvement and Incontinence Quality of Life scores.[A178669] It has also been shown to reduce the median incontinence episode frequency at doses of 40 and 80 mg.

Action at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord allows duloxetine to strengthen the the serotonergic and adrenergic pathways involved in descending inhibition of pain.[A178666,A178705] This results in an increased threshold of activation necessary to transmit painful stimuli to the brain and effective relief of pain, particularly in neuropathic pain. Pain relief has been noted in a variety of painful conditions including diabetic peripheral neuropathy, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis using a range of pain assessment surveys.[A178711]

While duloxetine has been shown to be effective in both animal models of mood disorders and in clinical trials for the treatment of these disorders in humans, the broad scope of its pharmacodynamic effects on mood regulation in the brain has yet to be explained.[A178714]

Increased blood pressure is a common side effect with duloxetine due to vasoconstriction mediated by the intended increase in norepinephrine signaling.[label,T116]","Duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake.[A178714] Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptors.

Action on the external urinary sphincter is mediated via duloxetine's CNS effects. Increased serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations in Onuf's nucleus leads to increased activation of 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and a<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors.[A178663,A178666] 5-HT<sub>2</sub> and a<sub>1</sub> are both G<sub>q</sub> coupled and their activation increases the activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C (IP<sub>3</sub>/PLC) pathway.[T116] This pathway leads to release of intracellular calcium stores, increasing intracellular calcium concentrations, and facilitating neuronal excitability. 5-HT<sub>3</sub> functions as a ligand-gated sodium channel which allows sodium to flow into the neuron when activated. Increased flow of sodium into the neuron contributes to depolarization and activation of voltage gated channels involved in action potential generation. The combined action of these three receptors contributes to increased excitability of the pudendal motor nerve in response to glutamate.

Also related to duloxetine's action at the spinal cord is its modulation of pain. Increasing the concentration of serotonin and norepinephrine in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord increases descending inhibition of pain through activation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic, and a<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors.[A178705] 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and a<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic mediate neuronal activation as described above. The activated neuron in this case is the GABAergic inhibitory interneuron which synapses onto the nociceptive projection neuron to inhibit the transmission of painful stimuli to the brain. The 5-HT<sub>1</sub> and a<sub>2</sub> receptors are G<sub>i</sub>/G<sub>o</sub> coupled and their activation leads to increased potassium current through inward rectifier channels and decreased adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A signaling which contributes to neuronal inhibition.[A178705,T116] These inhibitory receptors are present on the projection neuron itself as well as the dorsal root ganglion which precedes it and serves to directly suppress the transmission of painful stimuli.

The mechanisms involved in duloxetine's benefits in depression and anxiety have not been fully elucidated. Dysfunctional serotonin and norepinephrine signaling are thought to be involved and increases in the availability of these neurotransmitters at the synaptic cleft thought to mediate a therapeutic effect.[A178666] It is postulated that the involvement of serotonin and norepinephrine in area responsible for emotional modulation such as the limbic system contributes to the effects in mood disorders specifically but this has yet to be confirmed.

Duloxetine's hypertensive effect is related to its intended pharmacological effect. Increased availability of norepinephrine leads to activation of adrenergic receptors on the vascular endothelium. Since the action of a<sub>1</sub> receptors predominates, vasoconstriction results as the G<sub>q</sub> coupled receptor mediates calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to facilitate smooth muscle contraction.[T116]","Duloxetine is extensively metabolized primarily by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 with the former being the greater contributor.[label,A14807] It is hydroxylated at the 4, 5, or 6 positions on the naphthalene ring with the 4-hydroxy metabolite proceeding directly to a glucuronide conjugate while the 5 and 6-hydroxy metabolites proceed through a catechol and a 5-hydroxy, 6-methoxy intermediate before undergoing glucuronide or sulfate conjugation. CYP2C9 is known to be a minor contributor to the 5-hydroxy metabolite. Another uncharacterized metabolite is known to be excreted in the feces but comprises <5% of the total excreted drug. Many other metabolites exist but have not been identified due their low contribution to the overall profile of duloxetine and lack of clinical significance.","Duloxetine is incompletely absorbed with a mean bioavailability of 50% although there is wide variability in the range of 30-80%.[A14807] The population absorption constant (ka) is 0.168 h<sup>-1</sup>.The molecule is susceptible to hydrolysis in acidic environments necessitating the use of an enteric coating to protect it during transit through the stomach.

Amikacin's unique property is that it exerts activity against more resistant gram-negative bacilli such as Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Amikacin also exerts excellent activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacilli from the Enterobacteriaceae family, including Nocardia and some Mycobacterium (M. avium-intracellulare, M. chelonae, and M. fortuitum)[L4680]. M. avium-intracellulare (MAC) is a type of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) found in water and soil. Symptoms of this disease include a persistent cough, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and shortness of breath and the coughing up of blood.[L4680]

Several forms of amikacin are used currently, including an intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) injection.[F1949] In September 2018, a liposomal inhalation suspension of this drug was approved by the FDA for the treatment of lung disease caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteria in a small population of patients with the disease who do not respond to traditional treatment.[L4680,L4681]","37517-28-5","84319SGC3C",585.6025,585.285736487,"solid",3,2,0,3,"Alberto Mangia, Vicenzo Giobbio, Giorgio Ornato, ""Novel process for the synthesis of amikacin.""

Clinical studies have shown amikacin sulfate injection to be effective in bacterial septicemia (including neonatal sepsis); in serious infections of the respiratory tract, bones and joints, central nervous system (including meningitis) and skin and soft tissue; intra-abdominal infections (including peritonitis); and in burns and postoperative infections (including post-vascular surgery).[F1954]

Clinical studies have shown amikacin also to be effective in serious, complicated, and recurrent urinary tract infections due to the above organisms. Aminoglycosides, including amikacin, are not indicated in uncomplicated first-time episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics which are less toxic.[F1954]

In September 2018, a new indication with a new dosage route was approved for this drug.

Clinical benefit has not yet been established.[Label]

**Important notes regarding Staphylococcus and Sensitivity testing:**

Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, is the principal Gram-positive organism sensitive to amikacin.
The use of amikacin in the treatment of staphylococcal infections should be restricted only to second-line therapy, and should be limited to only those patients suffering from severe infections caused by susceptible strains of staphylococcus species who have failed to show sensitivity to other available antibiotics.[F1949]

Bacteriologic studies should be performed to identify causative organisms and their susceptibilities to amikacin. Amikacin may be used as initial therapy in suspected gram-negative infections and therapy may be initiated before obtaining the results of susceptibility testing.[Label,F1949,F1954]","Amikacin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. Aminoglycosides bind to the bacteria, causing misreading of t-RNA, leaving bacteria unable to synthesize proteins vital to their growth. Aminoglycosides are useful mainly in the treatment infections involving aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter. In addition, some mycobacteria, including the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, are susceptible to aminoglycosides. Infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria can also be treated with aminoglycosides, however, other antibiotics may be more potent and less toxic to humans.[Label,F1949]","The primary mechanism of action of amikacin is the same as that for all aminoglycosides. It binds to bacterial 30S ribosomal subunits and interferes with mRNA binding and tRNA acceptor sites, interfering with bacterial growth. This leads to disruption of normal protein synthesis and production of non-functional or toxic peptides. Other actions have been postulated for drugs of this class.[Label,F1949,F1950] Amikacin, as well as the rest of the aminoglycosides, are generally bacteriocidal against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.[L4680,F1954]","Amikacin's structure has been altered to reduce the possible route of enzymatic deactivation, thus reducing bacterial resistance. Many strains of Gram-negative organisms resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin have shown to be sensitive to amikacin in vitro.[F1949]

Following IM administration of a single dose of amikacin of 7.5 mg/kg in adults with normal renal function, peak plasma amikacin concentrations of 17-25 micrograms/mL are attained within 45 minutes to 2 hours.[F1949]

Following IV infusion of the same dose given over 1 hour peak plasma concentrations of the drug average 38 micrograms/mL immediately following the infusion, 5.5 micrograms/mL at 4 hours, and 1.3 micrograms/mL at 8 hours.[F1949]","The plasma elimination half-life of amikacin is usually 2-3 hours in adults with normal renal function and is reported to range from 30-86 hours in adults with severe renal impairment.[Label]","The protein binding of amikacin in serum is = 10%.[Label]","This drug is eliminated by the kidneys.

**Nephrotoxicity** 

Mild and reversible nephrotoxicity may be observed in 5 - 25% of patients. Amikacin accumulates in the proximal renal tubular cells. Tubular cell regeneration occurs despite continued drug exposure. Toxicity most commonly occurs several days following initiation of therapy. Amikacin may exacerbate pre-existing renal disease.[Label]

**Ototoxicity**

May cause irreversible ototoxicity.[Label] Ototoxicity appears to be correlated to cumulative exposure. Drug accumulation in the endolymph and perilymph of the inner ear causes irreversible damage to hair cells of the cochlea or summit of ampullar cristae in the vestibular complex. High- frequency hearing is lost first with progression leading to loss of low-frequency hearing. Further toxicity may lead to retrograde degeneration of the 8th cranial (vestibulocochlear) nerve. Vestibular toxicity may cause vertigo, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and loss of balance.[F1949,Label]

**Neuromuscular blockade**

In addition to the above, amikacin may exacerbate neuromuscular blockade, however, this is less common.[Label,L4680]

**Use in Pregnancy**

Category D. Gentamicin and other aminoglycosides are known to cross the placenta. There is evidence of selective uptake of gentamicin by the fetal kidney resulting in damage to immature nephrons. Eighth cranial nerve damage has also been reported after in-utero exposure to some of the aminoglycosides. Because of the chemical similarity, all aminoglycosides should be considered potentially nephrotoxic and ototoxic to the developing fetus. Therapeutic blood amikacin levels in the mother do not equate with safety for the fetus. In reproductive toxicity studies in mice and rats, no effects on fertility or fetal toxicity were observed.[F1949]

**Use in Lactation**

It is not known whether amikacin is excreted in breast milk. Since the possible harmful effect on the infant is not known, it is recommended that if nursing mothers must be given amikacin, the infants should not be breastfed during therapy.[F1949]"

However, it has a negligible effect on altering the development and progression of breast cancer itself.[label] The most common causes of osteoporosis include postmenopausal deficiency of estrogen and age-related deterioration in bone homeostasis. Due to the risk of bone fractures that may lead to morbidities and reduced quality of life, the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with the use of therapeutic agents in addition to concurrent therapies is critical. Due to the decline in estrogen levels in postmenopausal osteoporosis, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), such as estradiol, has been used to ameliorate the condition. However, due to the off-target actions by HRT, newer non-hormonal agents such as raloxifene and [tamoxifen] have been developed to reduce adverse events through selective pharmacological actions on tissue-specific therapeutic targets.[T28]

The main effects of raloxifene are to preserve the bone mineral density and decrease the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Compared to estrogen and tamoxifen, raloxifene was not associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer and it does not cause endometrial proliferation.[A716] Although rare, there was an increased risk of venous thromboembolism during clinical trials of postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene. In addition, a clinical study consisting of postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events showed an increased risk for fatal stroke with raloxifene therapy compared to placebo.[label] It is strongly advised that the risk-benefit ratio is considered before starting raloxifene therapy in women at risk of thromboembolic disease or strokes, such as the prior history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, or cigarette smoking.[label]","84449-90-1","YX9162EO3I",473.583,473.166079047,"solid",2,11,1,0,"Massimo Ferrari, Fabrizio Zinetti, Paolo Belotti, ""Process for preparing raloxifene hydrochloride.""

Raloxifene was shown to inhibit estrogen-dependent proliferation of human breast cancer cells _in vitro_ and development of induced mammary tumors in rats _in vivo_.[A721] In adult female rats, raloxifene produced a greater regression of the mammary gland than [tamoxifen].[A721] The MORE trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial that investigated the long-term effects of the drug therapy in European and American postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene for 40 months.[A719] Additionally, a reduction in the incidence of invasive breast cancer was also demonstrates in the CORE and RUTH trials.[A4979] Study findings demonstrated that compared to placebo, the risk of invasive breast cancer was decreased by 76% among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. There was a decrease in the risk of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by 90% but there was no increase in the risk of endometrial cancer. Unlike hormone replacement therapy, raloxifene does not mediate proliferative or stimulatory effects on endometrial tissue. Findings from both animal and human studies demonstrated no significant changes in the histologic appearance of the endometrium.[A4977]

Raloxifene promotes estrogen-like effects on lipid metabolism. In a European trial that evaluated lipid profiles following raloxifene therapy over the 24-month period, there were significant decreases in the serum concentrations of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol over a 24-month period of raloxifene therapy.[A4977] Raloxifene is not associated with causing alterations in the serum levels of HDL cholesterol or triglycerides.[A4977] As the HDL choesterol level is considered a strong inverse predictor of cardiovascular disease in women, the cardioprotective effects of raloxifene were questioned. Due to limited data on the long-term trials, it is not possible to determine whether the small lipid effects produced by raloxifene correlate with a smaller degree of cardioprotective activity compared with hormone replacement therapy.[A4977]","Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that acts as both an estrogen agonist and antagonist via differential effects on the tissue-specific estrogen receptors. Based on the findings of competitive binding assays, raloxifene displays binding affinity that is similar to that of [estradiol][A721], the predominant circulating estrogen.[A178861] Estrogens play variable roles at different tissues in females, including the bone, breasts, uterus and liver, by binding to the steroid nuclear hormone receptors, Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERa) or Estrogen Receptor beta (ERß).[A178861] These receptors are normally bound to the Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90) when unbound to the ligand. Ligand binding induces a conformational change in the receptor that promotes dissociation of the receptor from Hsp90, dimerization and translocation into the nucleus. This movement into the nucleus allows the receptor to bind to genomic locations based on sequence recognition of the DNA binding domain, also known as the Estrogen Response Elements (EREs).[A178861] 

In bones, endogenous estrogens normally modulate multiple DNA response elements, including the gene-encoding transforming growth factor-ß3 (TGF-ß3), which is a cytokine embedded in the bone matrix.[T28] TGF-ß3 plays an important role in bone remodelling[A178756] by working with other cytokines to induce production of osteoblasts, such as IL-6[A720], and attenuate the activity of osetoclasts. Estrogens typically maintain the bone integrity by inhibiting the cytokines that recruit osteoclasts and oppose the bone-resorbing, Ca2+-mobilizing action of parathyroid hormone. In contrast, estrogens promote osteoblast proliferation, augment the production of TGF-ß3 and bone morphogenic proteins, and inhibit apoptosis.[T28] Mimicking the action of endogenous estrogen in bone tissues, raloxifene binds to the estrogen receptor to influence gene transcription through interactions with the estrogen response element (ERE) and a distinct DNA target, the raloxifene response element (RRE).[A722] It occupies the same ER ligand binding site as estrogen.[A724] Upon binding, raloxifene induces a conformational change of the receptor, allowing mediation of direct binding to transcriptional elements by accessory proteins. Increased expression of bone matrix proteins, such as alkaline phosphatase, osteonectin, osteocalcin and collagen may be seen.[A722] The agonistic or antagonistic action of raloxifene depends on the extent of recruitment of coactivators and corepressors to estrogen receptor (ER) target gene promotors.[label] In breast tissues, raloxifene acts as an estrogen receptor antagonist to attenuate the estrogen-dependent proliferative effects of epithelial cell expansion. In addition to the antiproliferative effects, raloxifene prevents the production of cytokines and recruitment of macrophages and lymphocytes into tumor mass.[A178921]","Raloxifene is reported to undergo metabolism in the intestines and liver devoid of cytochrome P450 pathway.[A4977] It is extensively metabolized, where less than 1% of the total dose exists as unchanged compound.[label] It mainly undergoes first-pass metabolism to form glucuronide conjugates, raloxifene-4'-glucuronide (raloxifene-4'-ß-glucuronide), raloxifene-6-glucuronide (raloxifene-6-ß-glucuronide), and raloxifene-6,4'-diglucuronide. No other metabolites have been detected in human plasma. The terminal log-linear portions of the plasma concentration curves for raloxifene and the glucuronides are generally parallel. This is consistent with interconversion of raloxifene and the glucuronide metabolites.[label]","Raloxifene is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with approximately 60% fo the drug being absorbed following oral administration.[T28] Due to the extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism that involves glucuronide conjugation, the absolute oral bioavailability of raloxifene is about 2%.[T28] Following oral ingestion of a single dose or multiple dose of raloxifen in healthy postmenopausal women, the mean peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) were 0.50 and 1.36 ng/mL, respectively, and the AUC values were 27.2 and 24.2 ngxhr/mL, respectively. The time to reach Cmax following a single or multiple oral doses were 27.7 and 32.5 hours, respectively.[label] Although not clinically significant, oral ingestion of raloxifene with high-fat meals is thought to increase the systemic bioavailability of the drug[A4977] by increasnig the peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and AUC by 28% and 16%, respectively.[label]","The average plasma elimination half-life of raloxifene ranges from 27 to 32 hours.[A4977,T28] The prolonged half-life has been attributed to the drug's reversible systemic metabolism and significant enterohepatic cycling.[A4977]","About 95% of raloxifene and its glucuronide metabolites are bound to plasma proteins.[label] Although this is a relatively high protein binding profile, _in vitro_ studies suggest that raloxifene and its metabolites do not significantly interact with binding of highly protein-bound drugs.[A4977] FDA Label still advises patients to use raloxifene with caution co-administering with other highly protein-bound drugs.[label]","Raloxifene predominantly undergoes fecal excretion, with less than 0.2% of the dose being excreted in the urine as unchanged form of the compound and less than 6% of the dose being excreted as glucuronide conjugates. Co-administration with [cholestyramine], a bile acid sequestrant, was shown to reduce the enterohepatic recycling of raloxifene by 60%.[T28]","Following oral administration of single doses randing from 30 to 150 mg in postmenopausal women, the volume of distribution was about 2348 L/kg. Following oral administration of multiple doses, the value increased to 2853 L/kg. Raloxifene is widely distributed in the tissues. It is not known whether raloxifene is excreted in human milk.[label]","Following intravenous administration, raloxifene was shown to be cleared at a rate approximating hepatic blood flow.

The oral LD<sub>50</sub> value in rats is > 5000 mg/kg, which is about 810 times the human dose.[MSDS] In monkeys, no mortality was seen after a single oral dose of 1000 mg/kg.[label] No cases of raloxifene overdose have been reported during clinical trials. A rare postmarketing report of a non-fatal overdose after oral ingestion of 1.5 g has been reported. Common adverse events of leg cramps, hot flushes, and dizziness have been reported with the use of raloxifene at doses of greater than 180 mg. More serious adverse event of venous thromboembolic events were observed with raloxifene.[A721] Two 18-month-old children accidentally ingested 180 mg of raloxifene and symptoms of ataxia, dizziness, vomiting, rash, diarrhea, tremor, flushing, and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels were reported. There is no known antidote for raloxifene. [label] 

**Nonclinical Toxicology**

In a two-year mouse carcinogenicity study at raloxifene doses that are higher than the human therapeutic doses, there was an increased incidence of benign and malignant ovarian tumors of granulosa or theca cell origin. Another study showed an increased incidence of testicular interstitial cell tumors, prostatic adenomas, adenocarcinomas, and prostatic leiomyoblastoma in male mice receiving doses higher than human therapeutic doses. There was no evidence of the genotoxic potential of raloxifene in bacterial mutagenicity assays, _in vitro_ rat DNA assays, or other _in vitro_ rodent cell line assays. When assessing effects on the reproductive system of male and female rats, raloxifene caused lack of pregnancy and disruptions in estrous cycles and inhibited ovulation at dose of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day. Administration of raloxifene during the preimplantation period at doses greater than 0.1 mg/kg resulted in delayed and disrupted embryo implantation, further leading to prolonged gestation and reduced litter size. There were no effects on sperm production or quality or reproductive performance in male rats. The effects on the fertility by raloxifene were reversible.[label]

**A note on cardiovascular safety:** 

The concerns about the cardiovascular thrombotic risk of COX-2 selective NSAIDS emerged in the early 2000’s. Following an FDA Advisory Committee meeting in 2005, in which data from large clinical outcome trials in a wide range of indications and epidemiology studies of several individual NSAIDs were analyzed, the FDA concluded that the risk for cardiovascular thrombotic events was apparent for both COX-2 selective NSAIDs and nonselective NSAIDs [L3293].

Importantly, postmarketing cardiovascular outcomes trial (PRECISION) found that the lowest dose of celecoxib was similar to moderate doses of naproxen and ibuprofen in regards to cardiovascular (CV) safety [L3293]. Patients with recent cardiovascular events such as acute MI, coronary revascularization, or coronary stent placement were not studied in the PRECISION trial. NSAID use is not advisable in these groups of patients [L3293].

Early treatment and management of glaucoma, which predominantly involves the lowering of intraocular pressure, is critical since glaucoma is considered to be a common cause of blindness worldwide.[A178948,A178969] 

Ophthalmically, brimonidine is used to lower intraocular pressure by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Because it is oxidately stable, brimonidine is associated with fewer reports of ocular allergic reactions compared to other alpha-2 adrenergic agonists.[A178969] The ophthalmic solution of brimonidine was first approved by the FDA in 1996 as Alphagan [label] and brimonidine is the only selective alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist approved for chronic treatment in glaucoma.[A36674] Brimonidine is also found in ophthalmic solutions in combination with [brinzolamide] under the market name Simbrinza for the reduction in intraocular pressure. Unlike nonselective beta-blockers used in ocular hypertension, brimonidine is not associated with significantly adverse cardiopulmonary side effects.[A178945] Thus brimonidine is an effective and safe alternative to beta-blockers, in patients with, or at high risk for, cardiopulmonary disease.[A178948] The topical form of brimonidine was approved by the FDA in August 2013 for the symptomatic treatment of persistent facial erythema of rosacea in adults.

Indicated for the treatment of persistent (non-transient) facial erythema of rosacea in adults 18 years of age or older.[L6535]","Brimonidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that is 1000-fold more selective for the alpha2-adrenergic receptor than the alpha1-adrenergic receptor.[L6544] This characteristic gives the drug some therapeutic advantages, since it reduces the risk of systemic side effects, such as systemic hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation. In addition, there is a reduction in the risk for developing alpha-1 mediated ocular unwanted effects, such as conjunctival blanching, mydriasis, and eyelid retraction.[A179002] However, despite high alpha-2 receptor specificity, brimonidine may still produce alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated ocular effects, such as conjunctival vasoconstriction.[A178969] Brimonidine has a peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two hours post-dosing.[label] In a randomized, double-blind clinical study, ocular administration of 0.2% brimonidine in healthy volunteers resulted in a 23% reduction of mean intraocular pressure from baseline at 3 hours following administration.[A178951] In comparative studies consisting of patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, the ocular hypotensive effect of brimonidine was maintained during treatment periods of up to 1 year.[A178945] 

Brimonidine mediates vasoconstrictive effects and it was shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties in _ex vivo_ human skin model and _in vivo_ inflammation models.[A179041] In a clinial trials consisting of adults with moderate to severe facial erythema of rosacea, brimonidine was shown to improve the extent of redness at 3 hours after application, compared to placebo.[L6544] It was shown to be a potent vasoconstrictor of human subcutaneous vessels with a diameter of less than 200 µm. In _in vivo_ mouse inflammation models, brimonidine displayed anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting edema.[A178978] In a randomized, double-blind study, brimonidine reduced erythema for the 12 hours of the study in a dose-dependent manner.[A178978]

When adminsitered systemically, brimonidine was shown to cause cardiovascular effects by decreasing blood pressure, decreasing heart and respiratory rate, and prolonging the PR interval in the electrocardiogram. This is due to the targeting of adrenoceptors by the drug.[A178963,A178966] Although the clinical significance has not been established, there is evidence that brimonidine exhibits neuroprotective activity in experimental models of cerebral ischemia and optic nerve injury.[A178969] _In vitro_ studies show that brimonidine mediated protective effects on neuronal cells from kainate acid insult and on cultured retinal ganglion cells from glutamate-induced cytotoxicity, which is a possible mediator of secondary neuronal degeneration in human glaucoma. Neuroprotective actions of brimonidine were also demonstrated in rat models of acute retinal ischemia and chronic IOP elevation. It has been proposed that brimonidine may exert neuroprotective effects on the retina and optic nerve by enhancing intrinsic retinal ganglion cell survival mechanisms and/or induction of neuronal survival factors, such as bFGF.[A178951] However, further investigations are needed to conclude on these possible therapeutic benefits of the drug.","In the eye, alpha-1 adrenoceptors play a role in vasoconstriction, mydriasis, eyelid retraction, and elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) whereas alpha-2 adrenoceptors are responsible for IOP reduction via a complex Gi-coupled signaling cascade pathway. Activation of alpha-2 receptors leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and reduction of cyclic AMP levels. As a result, there is a decrease in norpinephrine (NE) release at the synaptic junction, NE-induced stimulation of beta-2 adrenoceptors, and production of aqueous humor by the ciliary epithelium.[A178969] An elevated IOP is the most significant risk factor for developing glaucomatous optic neuropathy, which is associated with progressive visual field loss and functional disability if left untreated.[A179002] Regardless of the etiology of the disease, the aim of current therapies for glaucoma is to reduce IOP, as reduction of IOP significantly reduces the risk of progression of vision loss even when IOP is already within the normal range.[A36674] When administered ophthalmically, brimonidine is rapidly absorbed into the eye, acts as an agonist at ocular alpha-2 adrenoceptors and lowers IOP via a dual mechanism of action.[A178981] It is proposed that initial dosing of the drug causes a reduction in aqueous humour production and chronic dosing leads to an increase in uveoscleral outflow.[A179002] Brimonidine does not affect episcleral venous pressure.[A178969] By reducing IOP, brimonidine aims to reduce the likelihood of glaucomatous visual field loss in ocular hypertension, and slow the progression of visual field defect in established open-angle glaucoma.[A178951] When applied topically on skin, brimonidine reduces erythema through direct vasocontriction of small arteries and veins.[A178978] As brimonidine mediates a potent peripheral vasoconstrictive activity by selectively working on the alpha-2 adrenoceptors, the use of brimonidine is thought to be efficacious for the treatment of facial erythema of rosacea, which is thought to arise from vasomotor instability and abnormal vasodilation of the superficial cutaneous vasculature of the face.[A178984]","Brimonidine is reported to be metabolized in the cornea. Brominidine that reaches the systemic circulation upon topical administration undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism mediated by hepatic aldehyde oxidases.[label]","Brimonidine readily penetrates the cornea following ocular administration [A178951] to reach pharmacologically active concentrations in the aqueous humor and ciliary body, the putative sites of its IOP-lowering activity.[A36674] Following ocular administration of 0.2% brimonidine solution, the peak plasma concentrations were achieved within 1 to 4 hours.[label]

In a clinical study of adult subjects with facial erythema of rosacea, brimonidine was cutaneously applied on facial skin in a repeated manner.

Oral LD<sub>50</sub> is 50 mg/kg in mice and 100 mg/kg in rats.[MSDS] While there is limited clinial data on brimonidine overdose in adults, some common symptoms from oral overdoses of alpha-2 adrenergic agonists include hypotension, asthenia, vomiting, lethargy, sedation, bradycardia, arrhythmias, miosis, apnoea, hypotonia, hypothermia, respiratory depression and seizure. [L6544] Treatment of an oral overdose includes supportive and symptomatic therapy. Cases of brimonidine overdose have been reported in neonates, infants, and pediatric patients receiving brimonidine tartrate as part of medical treatment of congenital glaucoma or by accidental oral ingestion. In these cases, children experienced symptoms consistent with previously reported oral overdoses of alpha-2 adrenergic agonists in young children.[L6544]

**Use in special populations**

Due to limited clinical data on the use of brimonidine pregnant or breastfeeding female patients, the use of brimonidine in these patients is generally not recommended and the use should be only considered after taking into account the benefit-to-risk ratio of continuing the drug therapy in these patients. In nursing mothers, the decision should be made whether to discontinue the drug or discontinue breastfeeding.[label] As the systemic absorption and elimination of brimonidine are not significantly affected by age, the use of brimonidine is considered safe in geriatric patients. In contrast, the use of brimonidine in infants under the age of 2 and pediatric patients under the age of 18 is strongly not recommended due to the reports of serious adverse events following ophthalmic administration of brimonidine in infants between the age of 28 days and 3 months.[L6544]"

Although structurally distinct from THC, nabilone mimics THC's structure and pharmacological activity through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, however it is considered to be twice as active as <U+0394><U+2079>-THC. Nabilone is approved by the FDA for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments [FDA Label].

Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Nabilone or [DB00470]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.

From a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others [A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function [A32676].

Systemic nonenzymatic protein glycosylation, as reflected by levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, is a function of average blood glucose concentration over time. Because its mechanism of action is different, the effect of miglitol to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylureas when used in combination.

Hydrolysis is thought to occur in the gastrointestinal mucosa and liver. Fosinoprilat is a competitive inhibitor of ACE, a peptidyl dipeptidase that is part of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may further sustain the effects of fosinoprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.","There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Fosinoprilat, the active metabolite of fosinopril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Fosinoprilat also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors.","Since fosinoprilat is not biotransformed after intravenous administration, fosinopril, not fosinoprilat, appears to be the precursor for the glucuronide and p-hydroxy metabolites.","Average absolute absorption is 36%.

Entacapone is used in the treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease as an adjunct to levodopa/carbidopa therapy. Entacapone selectively and reversiblly inhibits catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). In mammals, COMT is distributed throughout various organs with the highest activities in the liver and kidney. COMT also occurs in the heart, lung, smooth and skeletal muscles, intestinal tract, reproductive organs, various glands, adipose tissue, skin, blood cells and neuronal tissues, especially in glial cells. COMT catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the phenolic group of substrates that contain a catechol structure. Physiological substrates of COMT include dopa, catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) and their hydroxylated metabolites. The function of COMT is the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites. COMT is responsible for the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites. In the presence of a decarboxylase inhibitor, COMT becomes the major metabolizing enzyme for levodopa, catalyzing the it to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine (3-OMD) in the brain and periphery.","The mechanism of action of entacapone is believed to be through its ability to inhibit COMT in peripheral tissues, altering the plasma pharmacokinetics of levodopa. When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone. It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to a greater reduction in the manifestations of parkinsonian syndrome.","Metabolized via isomerization to the cis-isomer, followed by direct glucuronidation of the parent and cis-isomer.","Entacapone is rapidly absorbed (approximately 1 hour).

The efficacy of haloperidol was first established in controlled trials in the 1960s [L2014].

Interestingly, in vivo pharmacogenetic studies have demonstrated that the metabolism of haloperidol may be modulated by genetically determined polymorphic _CYP2D6_ activity. However, these findings contradict the findings from studies in vitro with human liver microsomes and from drug interaction studies in vivo.

The drug has action at all levels of the central nervous system-primarily at subcortical levels-as well as on several organ systems. Haloperidol has potent neuroleptic antiadrenergic activity and weak peripheral anticholinergic activity, as well as minor ganglionic binding ability. It also possesses slight antihistaminic and anti-serotonergic activity and may also act as an anti-emetic [L1996].","Haloperidol inhibits the effects of dopamine and increases its turnover, however, the exact mechanism of action is not fully understood [FDA label].  Dopamine overactivity can be presynaptic (an excess of dopamine release from dopamine nerve terminals) or post-synaptic (an increase in the density of D2 receptors or an increase in post-receptor action) [L2017].  Traditional antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, bind more tightly than dopamine itself to the dopamine D2 receptor, with dissociation constants that are lower than that for dopamine [A4962].

It is believed that haloperidol competitively blocks post-synaptic dopamine (D2) receptors in the brain, eliminating dopamine neurotransmission and leading to the relief of delusions and hallucinations that are commonly associated with psychosis. It acts primarily on the D2-receptors and has some effect on 5-HT2 and a1-receptors, with negligible effects on dopamine  D1-receptors. The drug also exerts some blockade of a-adrenergic receptors of the autonomic system [L2022].

Antagonistic activity regulated through dopamine D2 receptors in the chemoreceptive trigger zone (CTZ) of the brain renders its antiemetic activity [L1996].  Of the three D2-like receptors, only the D2 receptor is blocked by antipsychotic drugs in direct relation to their clinical antipsychotic abilities. The optimal clinical efficacy of antipsychotics is associated with the blockade of approximately 60 % - 80 % of D2 receptors in the brain [L2018].

Clinical brain-imaging findings show that haloperidol remains tightly bound to D2 dopamine receptors in humans undergoing 2 positron emission tomography (PET) scans with a 24h pause in between scans [A4962]. A common adverse effect of this drug is the development of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), due to the tight binding of haloperidol to the dopamine D2 receptor [FDA label]. Further information is found in the ""Toxicity"" section of this drug profile.  

Due to the risk of unpleasant and sometimes lifelong extrapyramidal symptoms, newer antipsychotic medications than haloperidol have been discovered and formulated. Rapid dissociation of drugs from dopamine D2 receptors is a plausible explanation for the improved EPS profile of atypical antipsychotics such as [DB00734]. This is also consistent with the theory of a lower affinity for D2 receptors for these drugs [L2018].  As mentioned above, haloperidol binds tightly to the dopamine receptor, potentiating the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms [A4962], and therefore should only been used when necessary.","Its metabolic fate has not been clearly established, it appears that haloperidol is primarily metabolized in the liver [L1996]. 

The drug is thought to be metabolized primarily by oxidative N-dealkylation of the piperidine nitrogen to form fluorophenylcarbonic acids and piperidine metabolites (which appear to be inactive), and by reduction of the butyrophenone carbonyl to the carbinol, forming _hydroxyhaloperidol_.

Some data suggest that the reduced metabolite, hydroxyhaloperidol, has some pharmacologic activity, although its activity appears to be inferior to that of haloperidol. Urinary metabolites in rats include _p-fluorophenaceturic acid_, _beta-p-fluorobenzoylpropionic acid_, and several unidentified acids [L1996].

The enzymes involved in the biotransformation of haloperidol include cytochrome P450 (CYP), carbonyl reductase and uridine di-phosphoglucose glucuronosyltransferase enzymes. The greatest proportion of the intrinsic hepatic clearance of haloperidol is performed by glucuronidation and followed by the reduction of haloperidol to reduced haloperidol and by CYP-mediated oxidation. 

In studies of cytochrome-mediated disposition in vitro, CYP3A4 appears to be the major isoform of the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of haloperidol in humans. The intrinsic clearance of the back-oxidation of reduced haloperidol to the parent compound, oxidative N-dealkylation and pyridinium formation are of the same order of magnitude. This suggests that the same enzyme system is responsible for the above three metabolic reactions [L1996].

Haloperidol is a substrate of _CYP3A4_ and an inhibitor, as well as a stimulator, of _CYP2D6_ [L1996].","
Haloperidol is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when ingested orally,  however, the first-pass hepatic metabolism decreases its oral bioavailability to 40 - 75% [L1996]. 

Administration of haloperidol decanoate (the depot form of haloperidol for long-term treatment) in sesame oil results in slow release of the drug for long-term effects. The plasma concentrations of haloperidol gradually rise, reaching its peak concentration at about 6 days after the injection, with an apparent half-life of about 21 days. Steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved after the third or fourth dose [FDA label].

Serum concentration peaks 0.5 to 4 hours after an oral dose [L1996].","
For the non-decanoate formulations, the haloperidol half-life is on average 24 hours after oral administration and 21 hours after intramuscular administration [L2028].","Haloperidol circulates in the blood bound predominantly (90-94%) to plasma proteins [L1996].","Urine 40% (1% unchanged), feces 15% [L1997]","The apparent volume of distribution is about 20 L/kg, in concordance with the high lipophilicity of the drug [L1996], and largely depends on the subject [L2028].

Haloperidol is rapidly distributed to various tissues and organs, as indicated by the large volume of distribution (mean values 8 to 21 L/kg after intravenous dosing). Haloperidol readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. It also crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk [L2028].","Haloperidol clearance after extravascular administration ranges from 0.9-1.5 l/h/kg, however this rate is reduced in poor metabolizers of C_YP2D6_ enzyme. Reduced CYP2D6 enzyme activity may result in increased concentrations of haloperidol. The inter-subject variability (coefficient of variation, %) in haloperidol clearance was estimated to be 44% in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with schizophrenia [L2028].","AloperidinJanssen-CilagBioperidoloFirmaBrotoponPfizerDozicRosemontDuraperidolEinalon SEukystolMerckleHalostenShionogi SeiyakuKeselanSumitomoLintonTanabe Mitsubishi PharmaPeluceslseiSerenacePfizerSigaperidolSiegfried",1,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00502.pdf?1265922799","//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00502.pdf?1265922739",1,2105,"Acute oral toxicity (LD50): 71 mg/kg  in rats [MSDS].  

Toxicity of haloperidol may be divided into several categories, according the FDA label:

**Cardiovascular Effects**

The incidence of sudden death, QT-prolongation, and Torsades de Pointes has been reported in patients treated with this drug. Higher than usual doses of any formulation and intravenous (IV) administration of haloperidol have shown to be associated with a higher risk of QT-prolongation and Torsades de Pointes [FDA label].

Caution is advised in treating patients with other cardiac QT-prolonging conditions (including electrolyte imbalance [particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia], drugs which prolong the QT interval, underlying cardiac abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and familial long QT-syndrome). Depot haloperidol is not to be administered by the IV route [FDA label].

**Extrapyramidal Symptoms**

Extrapyramidal symptoms are comprised of a group of movement disorders which may include dystonia, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia and parkinsonism. Drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms have been common knowledge for decades, yet the use of these drugs is still common. Despite this, these symptoms may prove to be long-lasting, and therefore, caution is warranted in the prevention of extrapyramidal symptoms [L2021].


**Tardive Dyskinesia**

This is a consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs and is known as an _extrapyramidal_ symptom [FDA label]. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be high among the elderly, this is a particularly common occurrence in elderly women [FDA label]

The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the risk that it may be irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient over time. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after brief periods of treatment at lower doses [FDA label].

There are no known treatments for established cases of tardive dyskinesia. The syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is removed [FDA label].

Antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of 
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome [FDA label]. 

**Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)**

A potentially fatal condition, sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been demonstrated in association with antipsychotic drugs treatment. Clinical signs and symptoms of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, alterations in mental status (including catatonia) and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Other signs include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute kidney failure [FDA label]. 

**General**

In addition to the above toxicities, number of cases of bronchopneumonia, some fatal, have followed the use of antipsychotic drugs, including haloperidol. One theory suggests that lethargy and decreased sensation of thirst due to central inhibition may lead to dehydration, hemoconcentration and reduced pulmonary ventilation. Therefore, if the above signs and symptoms appear, especially in the elderly, the physician should institute remedial therapy promptly.

**Hematologic Effects**

Reports have been made of the occurrence of mild, usually transient leukopenia and leukocytosis, minimal decreases in red blood cell counts, anemia, or a tendency toward monocytosis. Agranulocytosis has rarely been reported to have occurred with the use of haloperidol, and then only in association with other medication [FDA label].

**Liver Effects**

Impaired liver function and/or jaundice may occur.

**Dermatologic Reactions**

Maculopapular and acne-like skin reactions and isolated cases of photosensitivity and loss of hair.

**Endocrine Disorders**

Lactation, breast engorgement, mastalgia, menstrual irregularities, gynecomastia, impotence, increased libido, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and hyponatremia [FDA label]

**Gastrointestinal Effects**

Anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, hypersalivation, dyspepsia, nausea and vomiting [FDA label]

**Autonomic Reactions**

Dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, diaphoresis and priapism [FDA label]

**Respiratory Effects**

Laryngospasm, bronchospasm and increased depth of respiration [FDA label]

Protease inhibitors block the part of HIV called protease. HIV-1 protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into the individual functional proteins found in infectious HIV-1. Ritonavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are almost always used in combination with at least two other anti-HIV drugs. Modern protease inhibitors require the use of low-dose ritonavir to boost pharmacokinetic exposure through inhibition of metabolism via the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme pathway.","Ritonavic inhibits the HIV viral proteinase enzyme that normally cleaves the structural and replicative proteins that arise from major HIV genes, such as *gag* and *pol*. *Gag* encodes proteins involved in the core and the nucleocapsid, while *pol* encodes the the HIV reverse transcriptase, ribonuclease H, integrase, and protease [A19647]. The *pol*-encoded proteins are initially translated in the form of a larger precursoe polypeptide, *gag-pol*, and needs to be cleaved by HIV protease to form other complement proteins [A19647]. Ritonavir prevents the cleavage of the *gag-pol* polyprotein, which results in noninfectious, immature viral particles. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 isoenzyme present both in the intestinal tract and liver [A19647]. It is a type II ligand that perfectly fits into the CYP3A4 active site cavity and irreversibly binds to the heme iron via the thiazole nitrogen, which decreases the redox potential of the protein and precludes its reduction with the redox partner, cytochrome P450 reductase [A19648].

This drug is effective in the treatment of gastrointestinal infections including Cryptosporidium parvum or Giardia lamblia in healthy subjects. It is generally well tolerated. Nitazoxanide is a first-line, standard treatment for illness caused by C. parvum or G. lamblia infection in healthy (not immunosuppressed) adults and children and may also be considered in the treatment of illnesses caused by other protozoa or helminths [A31976].

Nitazoxanide has not been shown to be superior to placebo medication for the management of diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium parvum in patients with HIV/immunodeficiency [FDA label, A31973, A31976].","The general effect of this medication is the prevention of microbe activity through disruption of important energy pathways for survival and proliferation [FDA label, A31976].  Nitazoxanide exhibits antiprotozoal activity by interfering with the pyruvate ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductase dependent electron transfer reaction, an essential reaction need for anaerobic energy metabolism of various microorganisms.  Sporozoites of Cryptosporidium parvum and trophozoites of Giardia lamblia are therefore inhibited, relieving symptoms of diahrrea [L1425]. Interference with the PFOR enzyme-dependent electron transfer reaction may only be one of the many pathways by which nitazoxanide exhibits antiprotozoal activity [FDA label, A31973, L1425].","The most widely accepted mechanism of NTZ is believed to be the disruption of the energy metabolism in anaerobic microbes by inhibition of the pyruvate: ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) cycle [A31981]. In parasitic-protozoa, Nitazoxanide also induces lesions in the cell membranes and depolarizes the mitochondrial membrane while inhibiting quinone oxidoreductase NQO1, nitroreductase-1 and protein disulphide isomerase enzymes. In addition, this drug also inhibits the glutathione-S-transferase (a major detoxifying enzyme) and modulates the Avr-14 gene, encoding for the alpha-type subunit of glutamate-gated chloride ion channel present in nematodes. Aside from its well understood non-competitive inhibition of the PFOR in anaerobic bacteria, NTZ also demonstrates various other antibacterial mechanisms. It inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase in E Coli, disrupts the membrane potential and pH homeostasis in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis, suppresses the chaperone/usher (CU) pathway of the gram-negative bacteria,  and stimulates host macrophage autophagy in tuberculosis patients [A31976]. NTZ also suppresses viral replication by inhibiting the maturation of the viral hemagglutinin and the viral transcription factor immediate early 2 (IE2) as well as by activating the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a (an antiviral intracellular protein).

Additionally, a unique FDA approved oral liquid treatment is also available and indicated for the treatment of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea and enterocolitis caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_, including methicillin-resistant strains [L1196].","Vancomycin is a branched tricyclic glycosylated nonribosomal peptide often reserved as the ""drug of last resort"", used only after treatment with other antibiotics has failed. Vancomycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections: <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>, <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (including penicillin-resistant strains), <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i>, <i>Actinomyces</i> species, and <i>Lactobacillus</i> species. The combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside acts synergistically in vitro against many strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus bovis, enterococci, and the viridans group streptococci [FDA Label].","The bactericidal action of vancomycin results primarily from inhibition of cell-wall biosynthesis. Specifically, vancomycin prevents incorporation of N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM)- and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)-peptide subunits from being incorporated into the peptidoglycan matrix, which forms the major structural component of Gram-positive cell walls. Vancomycin forms hydrogen bonds with the terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine moieties of the NAM/NAG-peptides, preventing the incorporation of the NAM/NAG-peptide subunits into the peptidoglycan matrix. In addition, vancomycin alters bacterial-cell-membrane permeability and RNA synthesis. There is no cross-resistance between vancomycin and other antibiotics. Vancomycin is not active in vitro against gram-negative bacilli, mycobacteria, or fungi. [FDA Label]","Since almost 75-80% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine after the first 24 hours following administration, there is seemingly no apparent metabolism of the drug [FDA Label, A31723]. The concentration of vancomycin in the liver tissue and bile 24 hours after administration has also been reported at or below detection limits as well [A31723].","Poorly absorbed from gastrointestinal tract, however systemic absorption (up to 60%) may occur following intraperitoneal administration [FDA Label].","Half-life in normal renal patients is approximately 6 hours (range 4 to 11 hours).

Conversely, the most common adverse effects associated with vancomycin appear to be nausea, abdominal pain, and hypokalemia [FDA Label]. In particular, incidences of hypokalemia, urinary tracy infection, peripheral edema, insomnia, constipation, anemia, depression, vomiting, and hypotension are higher among subjects >65 years of than in those that are 65 years old or younger [FDA Label].

Additionally, nephrotoxicity involving reports of renal failure, renal impairment, elevated blood creatinine, and others has also occurred with vancomycin therapy during studies, and can occur during or after completion of a course of therapy [FDA Label]. Risk of such nephrotoxicity is increased in patients greater than 65 years of age [FDA Label].

Ototoxicity has also occurred in patients receiving vancomycin treatment, and it can be transient or permanent. This effect has been reported primarily in patients who have been given excessive intravenous doses, who have kidney dysfunction, who have an underlying hearing loss, or who are receiving concomitant therapy with another ototoxic agent like an aminoglycoside [FDA Label]. Potentially related adverse effects like vertigo, dizziness, and tinnitus have also been reported [FDA Label].

Neutropenia, often beginning one week or more after onset of intravenous vancomycin therapy or after a total dose of more than 25 mg has been observed for several dozen patients as well. This neutropenia however, appears to be promptly reversible when the vancomycin treatment is discontinued. Alternatively, thrombocytopenia has also been reported [FDA Label].

Additionally, a condition has been reported that is described as being similar to IV-induced symptoms involving symptoms consistent with anaphylactoid reactions, including hypotension, wheezing, dyspnea, urticaria, pruritus, flushing of the upper body (in what is known as the so-called 'Red Man Syndrome'), pain and muscle spasm of the chest and back. Although on average such reactions usually resolve within 20 minutes, they are just as likely to persist for hours [FDA Label, A760].

In a controlled clinical study, the potential ototoxic and nephrotoxic effects of vancomycin on infants were assessed when the drug was given intravenously to pregnant women for serious staphylococcal infections complicating intravenous drug abuse. The results obtained demonstrated that vancomycin was found in cord blood but that no sensorineural hearing loss or nephrotoxicity attributable to vancomycin was noted. Ultimately however, because the number of subjects treated in this study was limited and vancomycin was administered only in the second and third trimesters, it is not formally known whether vancomycin causes fetal harm. Subsequently, vancomycin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed [FDA Label].

Although it is known that vancomycin is excreted in human milk based on information obtained from the intravenous administration of the medication, it is not known if vancomycin is excreted into human milk after oral administration. However, because of the overall potential for adverse events, caution must be exercised when vancomycin is given to a nursing woman and a decision must be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into consideration the importance of the drug to the mother [FDA Label].

The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been formally established [FDA Label].

Patients older than 65 years of age may take longer to respond to therapy compared to patients aged 65 year or younger. Vancomycin treatment in patients aged older than 65 years subsequently should not be discontinued or switched to an alternative treatment prematurely [FDA Label].

Furthermore, clinical studies have demonstrated that geriatric patients are at increased risk of developing nephrotoxicity following treatment with oral vancomycin, which can occur during or after completion of therapy. In patients aged older than 65 years, including those with normal renal function prior to treatment, renal function should be monitored during and following treatment with vancomycin to detect any potential vancomycin induced nephrotoxicity [FDA Label]."

As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. In addition, these drugs add methyl or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn inhibits their correct utilization by base pairing and causes a miscoding of DNA.

It is metabolized to its biologically active diacid form, trandolaprilat, in the liver. Trandolaprilat inhibits ACE, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII). ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Trandolapril may be used to treat mild to moderate hypertension, to improve survival following myocardial infarction in clinically stable patients with left ventricular dysfunction, as an adjunct treatment for congestive heart failure, and to slow the rate of progression of renal disease in hypertensive individuals with diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria or overt nephropathy.","87679-37-6","1T0N3G9CRC",430.5372,430.246772208,"solid",1,12,0,0,"Narendra Joshi, Shekhar Bhirud, Buddhavarapu Ramam, Arjun Bodkhe, ""Process for the preparation of intermediates of trandolapril and use thereof for the preparation of trandolapril.""

Trandolapril is deesterified in the liver to the diacid metabolite, trandolaprilat, which is approximately eight times more active as an inhibitor of ACE than its parent compound. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that is part of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure via a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may further sustain the effects of trandolaprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure. The blood pressure lowering effect of trandolaprilat is due to a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, which is not accompanied by significant changes in urinary excretion of chloride or potassium or water or sodium retention.","There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Trandolaprilat, the active metabolite of trandolapril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Trandolaprilat also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors.","Cleavage of the ester group of trandolapril, primarily in the liver, is responsible for conversion to trandolaprilat, the active metabolite. Seven other metabolites, including diketopiperazine and glucuronide conjugated derivatives of trandolapril and trandolaprilat, have been identified.","~ 40-60% absorbed; extensive first pass metabolism results in a low bioavailability of 4-14%","The elimination half lives of trandolapril and trandolaprilat are about 6 and 10 hours, respectively, but, similar to all ACE inhibitors, trandolaprilat also has a prolonged terminal elimination phase that involves a small fraction of administered drug. This likely represents drug binding to plasma and tissue ACE. The effective half life of elimination for trandolaprilat is 16-24 hours.","Serum protein binding of trandolapril is ~ 80% (independent of concentration and not saturable) while that of trandolaprilat is 65 to 94% (concentration-dependent and saturable).","After oral administration of trandolapril, about 33% of parent drug and metabolites are recovered in urine, mostly as trandolaprilat, with about 66% in feces.","* 18 L","* 52 L/h [After approximately 2 mg IV doses]",NA,0,NA,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00519.pdf?1265922751",4,879,"Most likely clinical manifestations of overdose are symptoms of severe hypotension.

Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. They stop tumor growth by cross-linking guanine bases in DNA double-helix strands - directly attacking DNA. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. In addition, these drugs add methyl or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn inhibits their correct utilization by base pairing and causes a miscoding of DNA. Alkylating agents are cell cycle-nonspecific. Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death.","Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations.","Metabolism and activation occurs at the liver. 75% of the drug is activated by cytochrome P450 isoforms, CYP2A6, 2B6, 3A4, 3A5, 2C9, 2C18, and 2C19.

Unlike celecoxib, rofecoxib lacks a sulfonamide chain and does not require CYP450 enzymes for metabolism. Like other NSAIDs, rofecoxib exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activity. NSAIDs appear to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis via the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), which are responsible for catalyzing the formation of prostaglandins in the arachidonic acid pathyway. There are at least two isoenzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, that have been identified. Although the exact mechanisms have not been clearly established, NSAIDs exert their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic primarily through the inhibition of COX-2. The inhibition of COX-1 is principally responsible for the negative effects on the GI mucosa. As rofecoxib is selective for COX-2, it may be potentially associated with a decreased risk of certain adverse events, but more data is needed to fully evaulate the drug.","The anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects of NSAIDs appear to result from the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Although the exact mechanism of action has not been determined, these effects appear to be mediated through the inhibition of the COX-2 isoenzyme at the sites of inflammation with subsequent reduction in the synthesis of certain prostaglandins from their arachidonic acid precursors. Rofecoxib selectively inhibits the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, which is important for the mediation of inflammation and pain. Unlike non-selective NSAIDs, rofecoxib does not inhibit platelet aggregation. It also has little to no affinity for COX-1.","Hepatic.

TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, nortriptyline does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, nortriptyline exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake than tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline. TCAs also down-regulate cerebral cortical &beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine-H<sub>1</sub> receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. Compared to other TCAs, nortriptyline is less toxic and displays less drug interactions [A6584]. As a more selective noadrenaline reuptake inhibitor, nortriptyline is less likely associated with the hypertensive ‘cheese reaction' [A6584]. Nortriptyline exerts less anticholinergic and sedative side effects compared to the tertiary amine TCAs, amitriptyline and clomipramine. Apart from its indication to treat depression, nortriptyline has been investigated in chronic neuropathic pain (unlabeled use), fibromyalgia [A31911], irritable bowel syndrome (unlabeled use), diabetic neuropathy (unlabeled use) [A31912], post-traumatic stress disorder (unlabeled use), and migraine prophylaxis (unlabeled use).","72-69-5","BL03SY4LXB",263.3767,263.167399677,"solid",1,6,1,1,"Abraham Nudelman, ""ACID ADDITION SALT OF A NORTRIPTYLINE-GABA CONJUGATE AND A PROCESS OF PREPARING SAME.""

Nortriptyline has been observed to increase the pressor effect of norepinephrine but blocks the pressor response of phenethylamine [FDA Label].","It is believed that nortriptyline either inhibits the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin at the neuronal membrane or acts at beta-adrenergic receptors. It displays a more selective reuptake inhibition for noradrenaline, which may explain the relief and improvement of biological symptoms with nortriptyline therapy [T28]. Tricyclic antidepressants do not inhibit monoamine oxidase nor do they affect dopamine reuptake. As with other TCAs, nortriptyline displays affinity for other receptors including mACh receptors, histamine receptors and 5-HT receptors [T28]. Antimuscarinic effects upon binding to mAChR are responsible for various side effects of TCAs.","Nortriptyline undergoes hepatic metabolism via the same pathway as other TCAs, where it is metabolized via demethylation and hydroxylation followed by conjugation with glucuronic acid.

The mechanism of action of lamotrigine in reducing anticonvulsant activity is assumed to be the same for reducing biopolar depression. Lamotrigine demonstrates effectiveness in preventing the recurrence of mania and depression [T28].

Lamotrigine binds to melanin-containing tissues such as eyes and pigmented skin [FDA Label]. The metabolite of lamotrigine formed by glucuronidation, 2-N-methyl metabolite, is reported to cause dose-dependent prolongations of the PR interval, widening of the QRS complex, and, at higher doses, complete AV conduction block. Although the metabolite is only found in trace amounts in humans, the plasma concentrations of this metabolite may be increased in conditions where the extent of glucuronidation is reduced, such as liver disease [FDA Label].","Although chemically unrelated, lamotrigine resembles the actions of phenytoin and carbamazepine in inhibiting voltage-sensitive sodium channes thereby stabilizing neuronal membranes and consequently modulating presynaptic transmitter release of excitatory amino acids such as glutamate and aspartate [FDA Label]. Studies on lamotrigine show binding to sodium channels similar to local anesthetics, which could explain potential clinical benefit of lamotrigine in some neuropathic pain states [T28]. 

Lamotrigine displays binding properties to several different receptors. It mediates a weak inhibitory effect on serotonin 5-HT3 receptor with IC50 of 18 µM [FDA Label]. It also weakly binds to Adenosine A1/A2 receptors, a1/a2/ß adrenergic receptors, dopamine D1/D2 receptors, GABA A/B receptors, histamine H1 receptors, <U+03BA>-opioid receptor (KOR), mACh receptors and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors with an IC50>100 µM [FDA Label]. Lamotrigine had weak effects at sigma opioid receptors (IC50 = 145 µM) [FDA Label]. A study demonstrated an evidence _in vivo_ that lamotrigine inhibits Cav2.3 (R-type) calcium currents that could also contribute to its anticonvulsant activity [A31737]. This inhibition of calcium currents is also observed in topiramate.","Lamotrigine predominantly undergoes glucuronidation to form  2-N-glucuronide conjugate, which is pharmacologically inactive. Of total radioactivity detected in urine following oral administration of 240 mg lamotrigine, the components recovered consisted of unchanged lamotrigine (10%), the 2-N-glucuronide (76%), a 5-N-glucuronide (10%), a 2-N-methyl metabolite (0.14%), and other unidentified minor metabolites (4%) [FDA Label].","Lamotrigine is rapidly and completely absorbed with negligible first-pass metabolism. Its oral absolute bioavailability is 98% which is not affected by food intake.  Peak plasma concentrations is reached anywhere from 1.4 to 4.8 hours following drug administration, which varies depending on the dosing regimen of lamotrigine, concomitant medications, and epileptic states [FDA Label].","The mean elimination half life ranges from 12-59 hours. The value is dependent on dosing regimen, concomitant antiepileptic medications, and disease state of the individual.","The fraction of plasma protein is 55% in vitro. Lamotrigine is not expected to undergo clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites [FDA Label].","Following oral administration of 240 mg radiolabelled lamotrigine, about 94% of total drug and its metabolites administered is recovered in the urine and 2% is recovered in the feces [FDA Label].","The mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of lamotrigine following oral administration ranges from 0.9 to 1.3 L/kg and is independent of dose administered [FDA Label]. Lamotrigine accumulated in the kidney of the male rat, which is atttributable to a-2 microglobulin [FDA Label].","The mean apparent plasma clearance (Cl/F) ranges from 0.18 to 1.21 mL/min/kg.

Glycylcycline antibiotics have a similar mechanism of action as tetracycline antibiotics. Both classes of antibiotics bind to the 30S ribosomal subunit to prevent the amino-acyl tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome.

Anti-metabolites masquerade as purine or pyrimidine - which become the building blocks of DNA. They prevent these substances becoming incorporated in to DNA during the ""S"" phase (of the cell cycle), stopping normal development and division. Methotrexate inhibits folic acid reductase which is responsible for the conversion of folic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid. At two stages in the biosynthesis of purines and at one stage in the synthesis of pyrimidines, one-carbon transfer reactions occur which require specific coenzymes synthesized in the cell from tetrahydrofolic acid. Tetrahydrofolic acid itself is synthesized in the cell from folic acid with the help of an enzyme, folic acid reductase. Methotrexate looks a lot like folic acid to the enzyme, so it binds to it quite strongly and inhibits the enzyme. Thus, DNA synthesis cannot proceed because the coenzymes needed for one-carbon transfer reactions are not produced from tetrahydrofolic acid because there is no tetrahydrofolic acid. Methotrexate selectively affects the most rapidly dividing cells (neoplastic and psoriatic cells). Methotrexate is also indicated in the management of severe, active, classical, or definite rheumatoid arthritis.","Methotrexate anti-tumor activity is a result of the inhibition of folic acid reductase, leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis and inhibition of cellular replication.

The monomeric sequence in heparin and HS is thought to form the high affinity binding site for the natural anti-coagulant factor, antithrombin III (ATIII). Once bound to heparin or HS, the anticoagulant activity of ATIII is potentiated by 1000-fold. Fondaparinux potentiates the neutralizing action of ATIII on activated Factor X 300-fold. Fondaparinux may be used: to prevent venous thromboembolism in patients who have undergone orthopedic surgery of the lower limbs (e.g. hip fracture, hip replacement and knee surgery); to prevent VTE in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are are at high risk of thromboembolic complications; in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pumonary embolism (PE); in the management of unstable angina (UA) and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI); and in the management of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).","104993-28-4","J177FOW5JL",1508.263,1506.951330709,"solid",2,27,0,0,"Jean-Francois Branellec, Christian Morello, Pierre Potier, Patrick Trouilleux, Petrus Marcus Bastiaansen, Henricus Cornelis Claassen, ""Highly pure fondaparinux sodium composition, process for preparing said composition and pharmaceutical compositions containing it as active principle.""

Fondaparinux should not be used as the sole anticoagulant during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to an increased risk of guiding catheter thrombosis.","Fondaparinux binds specifically to the natural anticoagulant factor, ATIII. Binding to ATIII potentiates the neutralizing action of ATIII on Factor Xa 300-times. Neutralization of Factor Xa decreases the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, which subsequently decreases the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin (loose meshwork). The decrease in thrombin also decreases the activation of Factor XIII, which decreases the conversion of fibrin in its loose meshwork form to its stabilized meshwork form. Disruption of the coagulation cascade effectively decreases the formation of blood clots. Fondaparinux does not inactivate thrombin (activated Factor II). According to the manufacturer, fondaparinux has no known effect on platelet function. In studies comparing fondaparinux to enoxaparin, decreases in platelet levels were observed in similar numbers of patients from both groups (2-5%) [A871,A872]. At the recommended dose, Fondaparinux does not affect fibrinolytic activity or bleeding time. There is no antidote for fondaparinux. Monitoring of the anticoagulant activity of fondaparinux is not generally required. The anti-factor Xa assay may be used to monitor therapy in special populations such as those with renal impairment or who are pregnant. Complete blood count (CBC) and kidney function should be monitored during treatment.","The antithrombotic activity of fondaparinux is the result of ATIII-mediated selective inhibition of Factor Xa. By selectively binding to ATIII, Fondaparinux potentiates (about 300 times) the neutralization of Factor Xa by ATIII. Neutralization of Factor Xa interrupts the blood coagulation cascade and thus inhibits thrombin formation and thrombus development. It is thought that fondaparinux is unlikely to induce thrombocytopenia via a heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)-like mechanism given its chemical structure [A17488]. As a result, fondaparinux has been used as an alternative anticoagulant in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) patients [A33876,A33877,A33878]. However, it is important to note that rare cases of HIT have been reported in patients treated with fondaparinux [A33879,A33880].","Not metabolized","100% bioavailability when administered subcutaneously","17-21 hours","94% <i>in vitro</i> protein binding specifically to ATIII","In individuals with normal kidney function, fondaparinux is eliminated in urine mainly as unchanged drug.","* 7 - 11 L (healthy adults), distributed primarily in blood",NA,NA,6,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00569.pdf?1265922812",NA,0,1152,"As with other anticoagulants, the main concern is increased bleed risk.

**Limitations of use** [FDA label]

The efficacy and safety of valacyclovir have not been established in immunocompromised patients other than for the suppression of genital herpes in HIV-infected patients.
","**Antiviral effects**

Valacyclovir shows varying levels of inhibition towards herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1), 2 (HSV-2), Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of herpesviruses to antivirals and the clinical response of humans to the same antiviral therapy has not yet been elucidated. Sensitivity testing results, described by the concentration of drug needed to inhibit the growth of the virus by 50% in cell culture (EC50), vary widely depending on various factors [FDA label].

**Clinical study results**

For the various conditions below, clinical study results are summarized as follows [FDA label]:

_Cold sores_

Immunocompetent volunteers with cold sores were observed following the administration of a 1-day regimen (2 grams of valacyclovir twice a day for 1 day followed by one day of placebo) or a 2-day regimen (2 grams of valacyclovir twice daily for two days). The average duration of cold sore episodes was approximately 1 day shorter in treated subjects when compared to subjects treated with placebo. A 2-day drug administration regimen of valacyclovir did not provide superior benefit over the 1-day regimen. There was no clinically significant difference observed between subjects receiving valacyclovir or placebo in the prevention of progression of cold sore lesions after the papular stage, indicating that timing of valacyclovir administration is an important consideration [FDA label].

_Initial genital herpes episodes_

643 immunocompetent adults with first-episode genital herpes who presented within 72 hours of symptom onset were randomized in a double-blind trial to receive 10 days of valacyclovir 1 gram twice daily (n = 323) or oral acyclovir 200 mg 5 times a day (n = 320). In both groups, the median time to healing of herpetic lesions was measured to be 9 days, and the median time to cessation of pain was found to be 5 days, with the median time to cessation of viral shedding was approximately 3 days.

_Recurrent genital herpes episodes_

The results of 3 separate studies of patients taking  3 to 5-day regimens of valacyclovir showed an average of 4 days to lesion healing, 2-3 days to resolution of pain associated with the lesions, with an average of 2 days until the cessation of viral shedding [FDA label].  These findings showed valacyclovir administration to show superior beneficial effects when compared to the findings associated with placebo administration. 

**A note on resistance**

The resistance of Herpes Simplex Virus and Varicella Zoster Virus to acyclovir can result from qualitative and quantitative changes in the viral TK and/or DNA polymerase. Clinical isolates of VZV with decreased susceptibility to acyclovir have been isolated from patients diagnosed with AIDS. A total of 522 TK-deficient mutants of VZV have been identified in these cases [FDA label].","Valacyclovir is the L-valine ester of aciclovir. It is classified as a nucleoside analog DNA polymerase enzyme inhibitor. Aciclovir is a purine (guanine) nucleoside analog is a metabolite that heavily contributes to the pharmacological actions of valacyclovir. In fact, most of valacyclovir's activity is attributed to  acyclovir [A175885].

Valacyclovir is rapidly and almost completely converted in man to aciclovir and valine, likely by the enzyme _valacyclovir hydrolase_.
Aciclovir is a selective inhibitor of the herpes viruses, possessing in vitro activity against herpes simplex viruses (HSV) type 1 and type 2, varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), as well as human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). Aciclovir has been shown to inhibit herpes virus DNA synthesis after it has been phosphorylated to the active triphosphate form [F3949].

The first stage of drug phosphorylation for acyclovir requires activation by a virus-specific enzyme. In the case of HSV, VZV and EBV this enzyme is the viral _thymidine kinase_ (TK), which is only found in virus-infected cells.  The process of phosphorylation is completed (conversion from mono- to triphosphate) by cellular kinases. Acyclovir triphosphate competitively inhibits the virus DNA polymerase and incorporation of this agent results in DNA chain termination, stopping virus DNA synthesis and blocking virus replication [F3949]. The inhibitory capabilities of acyclovir are highly selective due to the drug's strong affinity for _thymidine kinase_ (TK)[FDA label].


In summary, the antiviral effects of valacyclovir are achieved in 3 ways [FDA label]: 

1) competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase

2) incorporation and termination of the growing viral DNA chain

3) inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase. The higher level of antiviral activity of acyclovir against HSV compared with VZV is attributed to its more efficient phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase (TK).","Valacyclovir is converted to acyclovir and L-valine via first-pass intestinal and/or hepatic metabolism. Acyclovir is also transformed, to a small extent, to inactive metabolites by _aldehyde oxidase_ in addition to _alcohol dehydrogenase_ and _aldehyde dehydrogenase_. Neither valacyclovir nor acyclovir is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes [FDA label].","After oral administration, valacyclovir hydrochloride is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and converted to acyclovir and L-valine. The absolute bioavailability of acyclovir after administration of valacyclovir was measured at 54.5% ± 9.1% after the administration of a 1 gram oral dose of valacyclovir and a 350 mg intravenous (IV) acyclovir dose to 12 healthy subjects. Acyclovir (a metabolite of valacyclovir) bioavailability from the administration of this drug is not affected by the administration with food [FDA label].","The plasma elimination half-life of acyclovir typically averaged 2.5 to 3.3 hours in several studies of valacyclovir in volunteers with normal renal function [FDA label].","The binding of valacyclovir to human plasma proteins is low and ranges from 13.5% to 17.9% [FDA label].","After oral administration of a single 1 gram dose of radiolabeled valacyclovir to 4 healthy subjects, 46% and 47% of administered radioactivity was measured in urine and feces, respectively, over 96 hours. Acyclovir accounted for 89% of the radioactivity excreted in the urine [FDA label].","Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration, determined by CSF/plasma AUC ratio, is approximately 25% for aciclovir and the metabolite _8-hydroxy-aciclovir_ (8-OH-ACV), and approximately 2.5% for the metabolite _9-(carboxymethoxy)methylguanine_ [F3949].  

In a study of immunocompromised pediatric patients, the volume of distribution of a 15 ml/kg dose of valacyclovir was 1.34 ± 0.65 L/kg [A175927].","Renal clearance of acyclovir following the administration of a single 1 gram dose of valacylcovir to 12 healthy

**Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility**

Valacyclovir was noncarcinogenic in lifetime carcinogenicity assays at single daily gavage doses of valacyclovir giving plasma acyclovir concentrations equivalent to human levels in the mouse bioassay and 1.4 to 2.3 times human levels in the rat bioassay. No clinically significant difference in the incidence of tumors between treated and control animals was observed, and valacyclovir was not found to shorten the latency period of tumors. Valacyclovir was tested in 5 genetic toxicity assays. An Ames assay was negative in the absence or presence of metabolic activation. An in vitro cytogenetic study with human lymphocytes and a rat cytogenetic study was negative [FDA label].

In the mouse lymphoma assay, valacyclovir was not found to be mutagenic without metabolic activation, however, in the presence of metabolic activation (76% to 88% conversion to acyclovir), valacyclovir was mutagenic. Valacyclovir was also found to be mutagenic in a mouse micronucleus assay [FDA label]. 

Valacyclovir did not impair fertility or reproduction in rats at 6 times the normal concentrations in human plasma [FDA label]. 

**Use in pregnancy**

Valacyclovir is categorized as a pregnancy category B drug. There are insufficient well-controlled studies of valacyclovir in pregnant women. The general rate of birth defects in infants exposed to acyclovir in-utero is comparable to the rate for infants measured in the general population. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the possible fetal risk [FDA label].

**Use in nursing**

Acyclovir, a major metabolite of valacyclovir, was excreted in breastmilk at lower concentrations when a normal therapeutic dose of valacyclovir was administered.   Exercise caution when acyclovir is used while nursing [FDA label]. 


**A note on renal function and toxicity in elderly patients**

Elderly patients and patients with decreased renal function are at increased risk of valacyclovir toxicity, which can sometimes lead to central nervous system effects, such as encephalopathy, agitation, dysarthria, mania, and psychosis, among other effects.  Consider reducing the dose of this drug in these populations to decrease the risk of toxicity [FDA label]."

Nevertheless, although lactulose received formal FDA approval in 1977 and has since become a readily available generic and brand-name non-prescription medication listed on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines as one of the most effective and safe medicines employed in a health system[L6205], data regarding its optimal place in therapy is often ambiguous.[L6202]

Especially considering the use of lactulose as a laxative is typically only considered after lifestyle and dietary modifications fail and the fact that lactulose therapy cannot be ethically withheld from patients diagnosed with PSE in a placebo study, the substance may just be one of many options available for treating constipation and its efficacy in managing PSE may never be formally confirmed or refuted via clinical investigation.[L6202]","4618-18-2","9XH2P2N8EP",342.2965,342.116211546,"solid",1,1,1,3,"Renato Carobbi, Franco Innocenti, ""Process for preparing high-purity lactulose syrup and the syrup obtained.""

Additionally, lactulose is also employed as an adjunct to protein restriction and supportive therapy for the prevention and treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE), including both the hepatic pre-coma and coma variations.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] In particular, lactulose solution has been effective at managing PSE resulting from surgical portacaval shunts or from chronic hepatic diseases like cirrhosis.[L6199]

Moreover, there have also been studies demonstrating the capacity for lactulose to minimize the formation of gallstones and even some investigations regarding the experimental use of the agent in developing novel anticancer agents owing to its ability to bind galactin carbohydrates involved in various tumor progressions [L6202].","Lactulose formulations are most commonly administered via the oral route or the rectal route.[L6202] Consequently, because the substance experiences minimal absorption by the gut it typically remains localized in the gastrointestinal tract environment and ultimately demonstrates almost all of its pharmacologic effects within the gut.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] In particular, as lactulose elicits its laxative effects in enhancing stool amounts and softening stool, such biochemical and physiologic activities can cause increased bowel sounds (borborygmi), a feeling of bloatedness, belching, frequent flatus, and diarrhea.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]","Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide derivative of lactose that consists of one molecule of galactose and one molecule of fructose.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Saccharolytic bacteria present in the large intestine subsequently break the substance down into organic acids like lactic acid and small amounts of formic and acetic acids.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Such resultant volatile fatty acid metabolites, in combination with hydrogen and methane that is also generated consequently enhance intraluminal gas formation, peristaltic gut motility, and elicit an osmotic effect that facilitates an increase in the water content of stool as well as associated stool softening.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] All of these actions ultimately assist in facilitating and increasing the frequency of bowel movements in patients experiencing constipation, although it may take 24 to 48 hours after using the medication for this laxative effect to become evident.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]

At the same time, the formation of such acids via the metabolism of lactulose by colonic bacteria also acidifies the contents of the colon, thereby contributing to the treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE).[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] As one of the principal features of PSE involves the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products like ammonia in the systemic circulation, a state in which the colonic contents become more acidic than blood allows ammonia in the circulation to diffuse into the colon.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]. Furthermore, ammonia that diffuses into the acidic colon is ionized to ammonium ions that are incapable of being absorbed back into the blood.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] These effects, combined with the laxative action of lactulose facilitates the excretion of excess ammonia.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] And finally, it is also believed that an acidic colonic environment results in the elimination of urease-producing bacteria that contribute to the formation of ammonia while surviving colonic bacteria use up any trapped ammonia in the colon as a source of nitrogen for protein synthesis.[L6202]","Lactulose is essentially only metabolized in the colon by saccharolytic bacteria that are present there.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] In particular, the substance is broken down into lactic acid and small amounts of acetic and formic acid.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Specific examples of bacteria that normally inhabit the large intestine that are capable of lactulose metabolism include Lactobacilli, Bacteroides, Escherichia coli, and Clostridia.[L6199]","After administration by the oral route, less than 3% of the given dose of lactulose solution is absorbed by the small intestine.[L6199] The remaining unabsorbed lactulose reaches the large intestine where it is metabolized - but even then, negligible quantities of unchanged lactulose or its metabolites are absorbed across the colon.[L6199,L6202]","The data regarding the half-life of lactulose is not readily available or accessible.","Negligible amounts of lactulose - metabolized or non-metabolized - are absorbed into the body.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202].

In clinical studies, enalapril reduced left ventricular mass, and did not affect cardiac function or myocardial perfusion during exercise.[A179134] Enalapril is not highly associated with the risk of bradycardia unlike most diuretics and beta-blockers [A179137] and it does not produce rebound hypertension upon discontinuation of therapy.[A179134]

Renin acts on the precursor prottein angiotensinogen, which is a plasma globulin synthesized from the liver, to produce cleaved peptide hormone angiotensin I.[T28] Angiotensin I then can be further cleaved by ACE to produce angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictive peptide hormone.[label] Present in different isoforms, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is peptidyl dipeptidase enzyme expressed in various tissues, including the vascular tissues, such as the heart, brain, and kidneys.[T28] ACE also plays a role in inactivation of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide.[T28,label] Angiotensin II mediates various actions on the body by working on its G-protein coupled receptors, AT1 and AT2.[T28] It causes direct vasoconstriction of precapillary arterioles and postcapillary venules, inhibits the reuptake of NE thereby increasing available levels, stimulates the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla, reduces urinary excretion of sodium ions and water by promoting proximal tubular reabsorption, stimulates synthesis and release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, and stimulates hypertrophy of both vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes.[L6619]

Enalapril is a pharmacologically inactive prodrug that requires hepatic biotransformation to form [enalaprilat], its active metabolite that works on the RAAS to inhibit ACE.[label] Biotransformation is critial for the therapeutic actions of the drug, as enalapril itself is only a weak inhibitor of ACE.[A179131] ACE inhibition results in reduced production and plasma levels of angiotensin II, increased plasma renin activity due to the loss of feedback inhibition by angiotensin II, and decreased aldosterone secretion.[L6586] However, plasma aldosterone levels usually return to normal during long-term administration of enalapril.[A179140] Decreased levels of angiotensin II subsequently leads to the dilatation of peripheral vessles and reduced vascular resistance which in turn lower blood pressure.[A179140] While inhibition of ACE leading to suppression of RAAS is thought to be the primary mechanism of action of enalapril, the drug was shown to still exert antihypertensive effects on individuals with low-renin hypertension. It is suggested that enalapril may mediate its pharmacological actions via other modes of action that are not fully understood.[label] As ACE is structurally similar to kininase I, which is a carboxypeptidase that degrades bradykinin, whether increased levels of bradykinin play a role in the therapeutic effects of enalapril remains to be elucidated.[label]","About 60% of the absorbed dose is extensively hydrolyzed to enalaprilat via de-esterification mediated by hepatic esterases.[label] In humans, metabolism beyond bioactivation to enalaprilat is not observed.[A179134]","Following oral administration, the peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of enalapril is achieved within 1 hour post dosing while the Cmax of enalaprilat occurs at three to four hours post dosing.[label] The steady-state is achieved by the fourth daily dose and there is no accumulation with repeated dosing.[A179134] However, accumulation of enalaprilat may occur in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min.[A179131] Food intake is reported to have a minimal effect on drug absorption.[A179119] Following oral administration, about 60% of enalapril was absorbed.[label] Bioavailability of enalapril averaged about 40% when intravenous enalaprilat was used as a reference standard.[A18459]","The average terminal half life of enalaprilat is 35-38 hours.

Maternal and fetal toxicity occudred in some rabbits treated with enalapril at doses of 1 mg/kg/day or more. There was no fetotoxicity, expressed as a decrease in average fetal weight, or teratogenicity in rats treated with enalapril at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day, which is about 333 times the maximum human dose.[L6586] In mice and rats receiving enalapril at doses ranging from 90 to 180 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect. Neither enalapril or its active metabolite were shown to be mutagenic or genotoxic in _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ studies. There were no adverse effects on reproductive performance of male and female rats treated with up to 90 mg/kg/day of enalapril. [label]

**Use in special populations**

Caution is warranted in patients who are concurrently using another ACE inhibitors with enalapril, as there have been incidences of agranulocytosis with the use of captopril, which is another ACE inhibitor. This adverse event may be particularly significant in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease.[label] As enalapril and enalaprilat were shown to be secreted in human milk in trace amounts, the use of enalaprilat in nursing women is not recommended.[L6586] Significant fetal transfer occurs with enalapril and enalaprilat thus the use of the drug in pregnant women should be strongly avoided. Caution is advised when enalapril is used in patients who are elderly or with renal impairment, as dosage adjustments may be appropriate. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is generally lower in individuals of African descent, usually a low-renin hypertensive population.[label]"

After binding the receptor, the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements in the promoter region of the target genes.[A16592] This effect promotes the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins (lipocortins). Through this mechanism of action, it is thought that fluocinolone induces mainly one of the lipocortins, annexin 1, which will later mediate the synthesis of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of arachidonic acid which is the precursor of all these inflammatory mediators.

It is an antihypertensive, potassium-sparing diuretic that was first approved for use in 1967 and helps to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. The drug is often used in conjunction with thiazide or loop diuretics. Due to its potassium-sparing capacities, hyperkalemia (high blood potassium levels) are occasionally observed in patients taking amiloride. The risk is high in concurrent use of ACE inhibitors or spironolactone.

This promotes the loss of sodium and water from the body, but without depleting potassium. Amiloride exerts its potassium sparing effect through the inhibition of sodium reabsorption at the distal convoluted tubule, cortical collecting tubule and collecting duct; this decreases the net negative potential of the tubular lumen and reduces both potassium and hydrogen secretion and their subsequent excretion.

It may also interfere with the biosynthesis of nucleic acids.","The mechanism behind the plasmodicidal action of chloroquine is not completely certain. Like other quinoline derivatives, it is thought to inhibit the heme polymerase activity, resulting in an accumulation of free heme, which is toxic to the parasites.  Inside red blood cells, the malarial parasite must degrade hemoglobin in vacuoles to acquire essential amino acids, which the parasite requires to construct its own protein and for energy metabolism. Degradation of hemoglobin involves the production of toxic heme, which consists of a porphyrin ring called Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX (FP). To avoid destruction by this molecule, the parasite biocrystallizes heme to form hemosoin, which is non-toxic, which is collected in the digestive vacuole as insoluble crystals. Chloroquine enters the red blood cell, inhabiting parasite cell, and digestive vacuole by simple diffusion. Upon entry into the digestive vacuole, chloroquine become protonated due the acidic nature of the vacuole and this prevents chloroquine from leaving the vacuole via simple diffusion. The drug then mediates its plasmodicidal effect by capping hemozoin molecules to prevent further biocrystallization of heme, leading to heme buildup. Chloroquine can also bind to heme to form the toxic FP-Chloroquine complex, which is highly toxic to the cell.

Testosterone is primarily secreted from the testes of males. In females, it is produced in the ovaries, adrenal glands and by conversion of adrostenedione in the periphery. It is the principal male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid. In both males and females, it plays key roles in health and well-being. Examples include enhanced libido, energy, immune function, and protection against osteoporosis. On average, the adult male body produces about twenty times the amount of testosterone than an adult female's body does.","Testosterone mediates its effects by activating androgen receptors directly or as DHT, or being converted to estradiol which acts as an endogenous lignad on estrogen receptors. Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5&alpha;-reductase. DHT displays an androgenic potency that is about 2.5 times higher than to that of free T. Upon formation, the T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows translocation of the complex into the cell nucleus and direct binding to the specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA as a transcription factor. These specific nucleotide sequences are also called hormone response elements (HREs) that, when activated, promote transcriptional activity of certain genes responsible for the androgen effects.","Testosterone is metabolized to 17-keto steroids through two different pathways.

It is a synthetic purine derivative and, similar to zidovudine, zalcitabine, and stavudine. Efavirenz was originally approved specifically for the treatment of HIV infections in patients who failed therapy with zidovudine. Currently, the CDC recommends that Efavirenz be given as part of a three-drug regimen that includes another nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (e.g., lamivudine, stavudine, zidovudine) and a protease inhibitor or efavirenz when treating HIV infection.","Similar to zidovudine, efavirenz inhibits the activity of viral RNA-directed DNA polymerase (i.e., reverse transcriptase). Antiviral activity of efavirenz is dependent on intracellular conversion to the active triphosphorylated form. The rate of efavirenz phosphorylation varies, depending on cell type. It is believed that inhibition of reverse transcriptase interferes with the generation of DNA copies of viral RNA, which, in turn, are necessary for synthesis of new virions. Intracellular enzymes subsequently eliminate the HIV particle that previously had been uncoated, and left unprotected, during entry into the host cell. Thus, reverse transcriptase inhibitors are virustatic and do not eliminate HIV from the body. Even though human DNA polymerase is less susceptible to the pharmacologic effects of triphosphorylated efavirenz, this action may nevertheless account for some of the drug's toxicity.","Efavirenz is principally metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system to hydroxylated metabolites with subsequent glucuronidation of these hydroxylated metabolites.

The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Prednisone can stimulate secretion of various components of gastric juice. Suppression of the production of corticotropin may lead to suppression of endogenous corticosteroids. Prednisone has slight mineralocorticoid activity, whereby entry of sodium into cells and loss of intracellular potassium is stimulated. This is particularly evident in the kidney, where rapid ion exchange leads to sodium retention and hypertension.","Prednisone is completely converted to the active metabolite prednisolone by 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. It is then further metabolized mainly in the liver. The exposure of prednisolone is 4-6 fold higher than that of prednisone.","Readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.

This helps control high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels.","Clofibrate is an antilipidemic agent similar to gemfibrozil. It acts to lower elevated serum lipids by reducing the very low-density lipoprotein fraction (S<sub>f</sub> 20-400) rich in triglycerides. Serum cholesterol may be decreased, particularly in those patients whose cholesterol elevation is due to the presence of IDL as a result of Type III hyperlipoproteinemia. Several investigators have observed in their studies that clofibrate may produce a decrease in cholesterol linoleate but an increase in palmitoleate and oleate, the latter being considered atherogenic in experimental animals. The significance of this finding is unknown at this time. Reduction of triglycerides in some patients treated with clofibrate or certain of its chemically and clinically similar analogs may be associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol. Increase in LDL cholesterol has been observed in patients whose cholesterol is initially normal. Animal studies suggest that clofibrate interrupts cholesterol biosynthesis prior to mevalonate formation.","Clofibrate increases the activity of extrahepatic lipoprotein lipase (LL), thereby increasing lipoprotein triglyceride lipolysis. Chylomicrons are degraded, VLDLs are converted to LDLs, and LDLs are converted to HDL. This is accompanied by a slight increase in secretion of lipids into the bile and ultimately the intestine. Clofibrate also inhibits the synthesis and increases the clearance of apolipoprotein B, a carrier molecule for VLDL. Also, as a fibrate, Clofibrate is an agonist of the PPAR-a receptor[4] in muscle, liver, and other tissues. This agonism ultimately leads to modification in gene expression resulting in increased beta-oxidation, decreased triglyceride secretion, increased HDL, increased lipoprotein lipase activity.","Hepatic and gastrointestinal: rapid de-esterification occurs in the gastrointestinal tract and/or on first-pass metabolism to produce the active form, clofibric acid (chlorophenoxy isobutyric acid [CPIB]).","Completely but slowly absorbed from the intestine.

Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase.

Folic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.","58-05-9","Q573I9DVLP",473.446,473.165896109,"solid",1,6,0,0,"James C.

At the onset of administration, nafarelin stimulates the release of the pituitary gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), resulting in a temporary increase of gonadal steroidogenesis. Repeated dosing abolishes the stimulatory effect on the pituitary gland. Twice daily administration leads to decreased secretion of gonadal steroids by about 4 weeks; consequently, tissues and functions that depend on gonadal steroids for their maintenance become quiescent. After nafarelin therapy is discontinued, pituitary and ovarian function normalize and estradiol serum concentrations increase to pretreatment levels. Recurrences of endometriosis are frequent after cessation of any hormonal therapy, or surgery that leaves the ovaries and/or uterus intact.","Like GnRH, initial or intermittent administration of nafarelin stimulates release of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland, which in turn transiently increases production of estradiol in females and testosterone in both sexes. However, with continuous daily administration, nafarelin continuously occupies the GnRH receptor, leading to a reversible down-regulation of the GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland and desensitization of the pituitary gonadotropes. This causes a significant and sustained decline in the production of LH and FSH. A decline in gonadotropin production and release causes a dramatic reversible decrease in synthesis of estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone by the ovaries or testes. Like normal endometrium, endometriotic implants contain estrogen receptors. Estrogen stimulates the growth of endometrium. Use of nafarelin induces anovulation and amenorrhea and decreases serum concentrations of estradiol to the postmenopausal range, which induces atrophy of endometriotic implants. However, nafarelin does not abolish the underlying pathophysiology of endometriosis. In children with central precocious puberty receiving nafarelin, serum LH, testosterone, and estradiol concentrations return to prepubertal levels. This results in the supression of secondary sexual characteristics and decrased rate of linear growth and skeletal maturation.

Though it has long been used in the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, epinephrine in the auto-injector form (EpiPen) has been available since 1987 in the USA. Many new products/biosimilars and dosage routes have been approved under various names over the last several decades [L4355], [L4356], [L4358].  On August 16, 2018, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA gained approval to market its generic epinephrine auto-injector in 0.3 mg and 0.15 mg strengths [L4353]. Dosage delivery routes for epinephrine include intravenous, inhalation, nebulization, intramuscular injection, and subcutaneous injection.

In general, the most common uses of parenteral epinephrine are to relieve respiratory distress due to bronchospasm, to provide rapid relief of hypersensitivity (anaphylactic or anaphylactoid) reactions to drugs, animal serums and other allergens, and to prolong the action of infiltration anesthetics [F2136]. In addition to the above functions, epinephrine is the primary drug administered during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to reverse cardiac arrest [A37697], [A37699].  It can be used in severe cases of croup [L4824].","51-43-4","YKH834O4BH",183.2044,183.089543287,"solid",2,7,0,9,"Pamela Albaugh, ""Pharmaceutical epinephrine-pilocarpine compounds and process of preparation thereof.""

Injectable epinephrine is intended for immediate/urgent administration in patients, who are found to be at increased risk for anaphylaxis, including individuals with a history of anaphylaxis. Selection of the appropriate dosage strength is determined according to body weight [FDA label]. 

Epinephrine's cardiac effects may be of use in restoring cardiac rhythm in cardiac arrest due to various causes but is not used in cardiac failure or in hemorrhagic, traumatic, or cardiogenic shock [F1247].

Epinephrine is used as a hemostatic agent. It is also used in treating mucosal congestion of hay fever, rhinitis, and acute sinusitis; to relieve bronchial asthmatic paroxysms; in syncope due to complete heart block or carotid sinus hypersensitivity; for symptomatic relief of serum sickness, urticaria, angioneurotic edema; for resuscitation in cardiac arrest following anesthetic accidents; in simple (open angle) glaucoma; for relaxation of uterine musculature and to inhibit uterine contractions. Epinephrine injection can be utilized to prolong the action of local anesthetics [F1247].

In addition to the above, epinephrine is used as an over the counter (OTC) agent for the intermittent symptoms of asthma, such as wheezing, tightness of chest and shortness of breath [F2131].  It is also used for the maintenance of mydriasis during intraocular surgery [L4825].","Epinephrine is a sympathomimetic drug. It causes an adrenergic receptive mechanism on effector cells and mimics all actions of the sympathetic nervous system except those on the facial arteries and sweat glands [F1247]. 

Important effects of epinephrine include increased heart rate, myocardial contractility, and renin release via beta-1 receptors. Beta-2 effects produce bronchodilation which may be useful as an adjunct treatment of asthma exacerbations as well as vasodilation, tocolysis, and increased aqueous humor production [L4825]. In croup, nebulized epinephrine is associated with both clinically and statistically significant transient reduction of croup symptoms 30 minutes post-treatment [A40032]. Epinephrine also alleviates pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema and may be helpful in relieving gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms associated with anaphylaxis because of its relaxing effects on the smooth muscle of the stomach, intestine, uterus, and urinary bladder [FDA label].","Epinephrine acts on alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors. Epinephrine acts on alpha and beta receptors and is the strongest alpha receptor activator [F1247]. Through its action on alpha-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine minimizes the vasodilation and increased the vascular permeability that occurs during anaphylaxis, which can cause the loss of intravascular fluid volume as well as hypotension.  Epinephrine relaxes the smooth muscle of the bronchi and iris and is a histamine antagonist, rendering it useful in treating the manifestations of allergic reactions and associated conditions [F2136]. This drug also produces an increase in blood sugar and increases glycogenolysis in the liver [F1247]. Through its action on beta-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine leads to bronchial smooth muscle relaxation that helps to relieve bronchospasm, wheezing, and dyspnea that may occur during anaphylaxis [FDA label].","Epinephrine is rapidly inactivated mainly by enzymic transformation to metanephrine or normetanephrine, either of which is then conjugated and excreted in the urine in the form of both sulfates and glucuronides. Either sequence results in the formation of 3-methoxy-4- hydroxy-mandelic acid(vanillylmandelic acid, VMA) which is shown to be detectable in the urine [F1247].  Epinephrine is rapidly inactivated in the body mostly by the enzymes COMT (catechol-O-methyltransferase) and MAO (monoamine oxidase). The liver is abundant in the above enzymes, and is a primary, although not essential, tissue in the degradation process [L4361].","Following I.V. (intravenous) injection, epinephrine disappears rapidly from the blood stream. Subcutaneously or I.M. (intramuscular) administered epinephrine has a rapid onset and short duration of action. Subcutaneous (SC) administration during asthmatic attacks may produce bronchodilation within 5 to 10 minutes, and maximal effects may occur within 20 minutes. The drug becomes fixed in the tissues rapidly [F1247], [FDA label].","The plasma half-life is approximately 2-3 minutes. However, when administered by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, local vasoconstriction may delay absorption so that epinephrine's effects may last longer than the half-life suggests [L4361].",NA,"The majority of the dose of epinephrine is seen excreted in the urine [L4361], [FDA label].
 About 40% of a parenteral dose of epinephrine is excreted in urine as metanephrine, 40% as VMA, 7% as 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenoglycol, 2% as 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and the rest as acetylated derivatives. These metabolites are excreted mainly as the sulfate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, the glucuronide conjugates. Only small amounts of the drug are excreted completely unchanged [L4827].",NA,"Intravenous injection produces an immediate and intensified response.

**Pregnancy**

Epinephrine is teratogenic in rats when given in doses about 25 times the human doses. It is unknown whether epinephrine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Epinephrine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly required in critical situations/emergencies [F2136].

**Labor and Delivery**
Parenteral administration of epinephrine, if used as support for blood pressure during low or other spinal anesthesia for delivery, can lead to the acceleration of fetal heart rate and should not be used in obstetrics when maternal blood pressure is higher than 130/80. Epinephrine may delay the second stage of labour.

**Common and generalized adverse effects**:
Transient and minor side effects of anxiety, headache, fear, and palpitations may occur with therapeutic doses of epinephrine, especially in hyperthyroid individuals. Repeated local injections may result in necrosis at sites of injection due to vascular constriction. Cerebral hemorrhage; hemiplegia; subarachnoid hemorrhage; anginal pain in patients with angina pectoris; anxiety; restlessness; throbbing headache; tremor; weakness; dizziness; pallor; respiratory difficulty; palpitation; apprehensiveness; sweating; nausea; vomiting [FDA label].

**Cardiovascular effects:** Inadvertently induced high arterial blood pressure may result in angina pectoris (especially when coronary insufficiency is present), cardiac ischemia, or aortic rupture [FDA label], [L4825]. Epinephrine may cause serious cardiac arrhythmias in patients not suffering from heart disease and patients with organic heart disease receiving drugs that sensitize the cardiac muscle. With the injection of epinephrine 1:1,000, a paradoxical but transient lowering of blood pressure, bradycardia and apnea may occur immediately post-injection [FDA label].

**Cerebrovascular hemorrhage**: Overdosage or accidental I.V. injection of epinephrine may lead to cerebrovascular hemorrhage resulting from the sharp rise in blood pressure [FDA label].

**Renal vasoconstriction**:  Parenterally administered epinephrine initially may produce constriction of renal blood vessels and decrease urine formation. High doses may cause complete renal shutdown [F2136].

**Pulmonary edema**: Fatality may also result from pulmonary edema due to the peripheral constriction and cardiac stimulation produced by epinephrine injection [FDA label].

**Digital vasoconstriction**: Since epinephrine is a strong vasoconstrictor, accidental injection into the digits, hands or feet may lead to the loss of blood flow to the affected area. Treatment should be directed at vasodilation in addition to further treatment of anaphylaxis [FDA label].

This results in a blockage or change in the expression of estrogen dependent genes. The prolonged binding of tamoxifen to the nuclear chromatin of these results in reduced DNA polymerase activity, impaired thymidine utilization, blockade of estradiol uptake, and decreased estrogen response. It is likely that tamoxifen interacts with other coactivators or corepressors in the tissue and binds with different estrogen receptors, ER-alpha or ER-beta, producing both estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects.","Hepatic. Tamoxifen is extensively metabolized after oral administration. N-Desmethyl-tamoxifen is the major metabolite found in plasma. N-Desmethyl-tamoxifen's activity is similar to tamoxifen. 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen and a side chain primary alcohol derivative of tamoxifen have been identified as minor metabolites in plasma. 4-Hydroxy-tamoxifen formation is catalyzed mainly by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6, and also by CYP2C9 and 3A4. At high tamoxifen concentrations, CYP2B6 also catalyzes 4-hydroxylation of the parent drug. 4-Hydroxy-tamoxifen possesses 30- to 100-times greater affinity for the estrogen receptor and 30- to 100-times greater potency at inhibiting estrogen-dependent cell proliferation compared to tamoxifen. It is also metabolized by flavin monooxygenases FMO1 and FMO3 to form tamoxifen-N-oxide.","When a single oral dose of 20 mg is given, the average peak plasma concentration (Cmax) is 40 ng/mL which occurred approximately 5 hours after dosing (Tmax).

Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, ARBs do not have the adverse effect of dry cough.

It may also be used as an alternative agent for the treatment of systolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and heart failure.","114798-26-4","JMS50MPO89",422.911,422.162187095,"solid",1,4,2,0,"Gordon C.

May be used as a first line agent to delay progression of diabetic nephropathy. Losartan may be also used as a second line agent in the treatment of congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease in those intolerant of ACE inhibitors.","Losartan is the first of a class of antihypertensive agents called angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Losartan and its longer acting active metabolite, E-3174, are specific and selective type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) antagonists which block the blood pressure increasing effects angiotensin II via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. Renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by increasing total peripheral resistance, increasing sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys via aldosterone secretion, and altering cardiovascular structure. Angiotensin II binds to two receptors: AT1 and type-2 angiotensin II receptor (AT2). AT1 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that mediates the vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. Studies performed in recent years suggest that AT2 antagonizes AT1-mediated effects and directly affects long-term blood pressure control by inducing vasorelaxation and increasing urinary sodium excretion. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are non-peptide competitive inhibitors of AT1. ARBs block the ability of angiotensin II to stimulate pressor and cell proliferative effects. Unlike ACE inhibitors, ARBs do not affect bradykinin-induced vasodilation. The overall effect of ARBs is a decrease in blood pressure.","Losartan competitively inhibits the binding of angiotensin II to AT1 in many tissues including vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal glands. Losartan is metabolized to its active metabolite, E-3174, which is 10 to 40 times more potent than losartan and acts as a non-competitive AT1 antagonist. Inhibition of angiotensin II binding to AT1 inhibits its AT1-mediated vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects and results in decreased vascular resistance and blood pressure. Losartan is 1,000 times more selective for AT1 than AT2. Inhibition of aldosterone secretion may increase sodium and water excretion while decreasing potassium excretion. Losartan is effective for reducing blood pressure and may be used to treat essential hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and diabetic nephropathy.","Hepatic. Losartan is metabolized to a 5-carboxylic acid derivative (E-3174) via an aldehyde intermediate (E-3179) primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and CYP3A4. E-3174 is an active metabolite with 10- to 40-fold higher potency than its parent compound, losartan. Approxiamtely 14% of losartan is converted to E-3174; however, the AUC of E-3174 was found to be 4- to 8-fold higher than losartan and E-3174 is considered the main contributor to the pharmacologic effects of this medication.","Losartan is well absorbed and undergoes substantial first-pass metabolism; the systemic bioavailability of losartan is approximately 33%.

Although originally marketed as a pesticide (d-Con, Rodex, among others), Warfarin has since become the most frequently prescribed oral anticoagulant in North America. Warfarin has several properties that should be noted when used medicinally, including its ability to cross the placental barrier during pregnancy which can result in fetal bleeding, spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Additional adverse effects such as necrosis, purple toe syndrome, osteoporosis, valve and artery calcification, and drug interactions have also been documented with warfarin use. Warfarin does not actually affect blood viscosity, rather, it inhibits vitamin-k dependent synthesis of biologically active forms of various clotting factors in addition to several regulatory factors.","81-81-2","5Q7ZVV76EI",308.3279,308.104859,"solid",1,14,2,4,"Nasri W.

2) Prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolism associated with atrial fibrillation.

3) Prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolism associated with cardiac valve replacement.

4) Use as adjunct therapy to reduce mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, and thromboembolic events post myocardial infarction.

**Off-label** uses include:

1) Secondary prevention of stroke and transient ischemic attacks in patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease but without atrial fibrillation.[A179182]","Warfarin is an anticoagulant, as such it disrupts the coagulation cascade to reduce frequency and extent of thrombus formation.[label,L6616] In patients with deep vein thrombosis or atrial fibrillation there is an increased risk of thrombus formation due to the reduced movement of blood.[T622] For patients with cardiac valve disease or valve replacements this increased coagulability is due to tissue damage. Thrombi due to venous thrombosis can travel to the lungs and become pulmonary emboli, blocking circulation to a portion of lung tissue. Thrombi which form in the heart can travel to the brain and cause ischemic strokes. Prevention of these events is the primary goal of warfarin therapy.

Limitation of thrombus formation is also a source of adverse effects. In patients with atheroscelotic plaques rupture typically results in thrombus formation.[A179212] When these patients are anticoagulated plaque rupture can allow the escape of cholesterol from the lipid core in the form of atheroemboli or cholesterol microemboli. These emboli are smaller than thrombi and block smaller vessels, usually less than 200 µm in diameter. The consequences of this are varied and depend on the location of the blockage. Effects include visual disturbances, acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease, central nervous system ischemia, and purple or blue toe syndrome.[label,A179212] Blue toe syndrome can be reversed if it has not progressed to tissue necrosis but the other effects of microemboli are often permanent.

Antocoagulation appears to mediate warfarin-related nephropathy, a seemingly spontaneous kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease associated with warfarin therapy.[A179215] Nephropathy in this case appears to be due to increased passage of red blood cells through the glomerulus and subsequent blockage of renal tubules with red blood cell casts. This is worsened or possibly triggered by pre-existing kidney damage. Increased risk of warfarin-related nephropathy occurs at INRs over 3.0 but risk does not increase as a function of INR beyond this point.

Warfarin has been linked to the development of calciphylaxis.[label] This is thought to be due to warfarin's inhibition of [vitamin K](VKA) recycling as VKA is needed for the carboxylation of matrix Gla protein.[A179218] This protein is an anti-calcification factor and its inhibition through preventing the carboxylation step in its production leads to a shift in calcification balance in favor of calciphylaxis. 

Tissue necrosis can occur early on in warfarin therapy.[label] This is attributable to half lives of the clotting factors impacted by inhibition of vitamin K recycling.[label,A179221] Proteins C and S are anticoagulation factors with half lives of 8 and 24 hours respectively. The coagulation factors IX, X, VII, and thrombin (factor II) have half lives of 24, 36, 6, and 50 hours respectively. This means proteins C and S are inactivated sooner than pro-coagulation proteins, with the exception of factor VII, resulting in a pro-thrombotic state for the first few days of therapy. Thrombi which form in this time period can occlude arterioles in various locations, blocking blood flow and causing tissue necrosis due to ischemia.","Warfarin is a [vitamin K] antagonist which acts to inhibit the production of vitamin K by vitamin K epoxide reductase.[label,A179221,T116] The reduced form of vitamin K, vitamin KH<sub>2</sub> is a cofactor used in the <U+03B3>-carboxylation of coagulation factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin. Carboxylation induces a conformational change allowing the factors to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and to phospholipid surfaces. Uncarboxylated factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin are biologically inactive and therefore serve to interrupt the coagulation cascade. The endogenous anticoagulation proteins C and S also require  <U+03B3>-carboxylation to function. This is particularly true in the case of thrombin which must be activated in order to form a thrombus. vitamin KH<sub>2</sub> is converted to vitamin K epoxide as part of the <U+03B3>-carboxylation reaction catalyzed by <U+03B3>-glutamyl carboxylase. Vitamin K epoxide is then converted to vitamin K<sub>1</sub> by vitamin K epoxide reductase then back to vitamin KH<sub>2</sub> by vitamin K reductase. Warfarin binds to vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 and irreversibly inhibits the enzyme thereby stopping the recycling of vitamin K by preventing the conversion of vitamin K epoxide to vitamin K<sub>1</sub>. This process creates a hypercoagulable state for a short time as proteins C and S degrade first with half lives of 8 and 24 hours, with the exception of factor VII which has a half life of 6 hours.[A179221] Factors IX, X, and finally thrombin degrade later with half lives of 24, 36, and 50 hours resulting in a dominant anticoagulation effect.[A179221] In order to reverse this anticoagulation vitamin K must be supplied, either exogenously or by removal of the vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibition, and time allowed for new coagulation factors to be synthesized.[label,A179221,T116] It takes approximately 2 days for new coagulation factors to be synthesized in the liver. Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, functionally identical to vitamin K<sub>1</sub>, is synthesized by gut bacteria leading to interactions with antibiotics as elimination of these bacteria can reduce vitamin K<sub>2</sub supply and result in a greater anticoagulation effect.[T116]","Metabolism of warfarin is both stereo- and regio-selective.[A2460] The major metabolic pathway is oxidation to various hydroxywarfarins, comprising 80-85% of the total metabolites. CYP2C9 is the major enzyme catalyzing the 6- and 7-hydroxylation of S-warfarin while 4'-hydroxylation occurs through CYP2C18 with minor contributions from CYP2C19. R-warfarin is metabolized to 4'-hydroxywarfarin by CYP2C8 with some contirbuting by CYP2C19, 6- and 8-hydroxywarfarin by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, 7-hydroxywarfarin by CYP1A2 and CYP2C8, and lastly to 10-hydroxywarfarin by CYP3A4. The 10-hydroxywarfarin metabolite as well as a benzylic alcohol metabolite undergo an elimination step to form dehydrowarfarin. The minor pathway of metabolism is the reduction of the ketone group to warfarin alcohols, comprising 20% of the metabolites. Limited conjugation occurs with sulfate and gluronic acid groups but these metabolites have only been confirmed for R-hydroxywarfarins.","Completely absorbed from the GI tract.

**Overdose**

Doses of 1-2 mg/kg/day over a period of 15 days have been fatal in humans.[L6625] Warfarin overdose is primarily associated with major bleeding particularly from the mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary system.[label,L6625] Epistaxis, ecchymoses, as well as renal and hepatic bleeding are also associated. These symptoms become apparent within 2-4 days of overdose although increases in prothrombin time can be observed within 24 hours. Treatment for overdosed patients includes discontinuation of warfarin and administration of [vitamin K]. For more urgent reversal of anticoagulation [prothrombin] complex concentrate, blood plasma, or [coagulation factor VIIa] infusion can be used.[label] Patients can be safely re-anticoagulated after reversal of the overdose.

**Carcinogenicity & Mutagenicity**

The carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of warfarin have not been thoroughly investigated.[label]

**Reproductive Toxicity**

Warfarin is known to be a teratogen and its use during pregnancy is contraindicated in the absence of high thrombotic risk.[label,L6625] Fetal warfarin syndrome, attributed to exposure during the 1st trimester, is characterized by nasal hypoplasia with or without stippled epiphyses, possible failure of nasal septum development, and low birth weight. Either dorsal midline dysplasia or ventral midline dysplasia can occur. Dorsal midline dysplasia includes agenisis of the corpus callosum, Dandy-Walker malformations, midline cerebellar hypoplasia. Ventral midline dysplasia is characterized by eye anomalies which can potentially include optic atrophy, blindness, and microphthalmia. Exposure during the 2nd and 3rd trimester is associated with hypoplasia of the extremities, developmental retardation, microcephaly, hydrocephaly, schizencephaly, seizures, scoliosis, deafness, congenital heart malformations, and fetal death. The critical exposure period is estimated to be week 6-9 based on case reports. Effects noted in the Canadian product monograph include developing a single kidney, asplenia, anencephaly, spina bifida, cranial nerve palsy, polydactyl malformations, corneal leukoma, diaphragm hernia, and cleft palate.[L6616]

**Lactation**

Official product monographs mention a study in 15 women.[label,L6616] Warfarin was not detected in the breast milk of any woman and 6 infants were documented as having normal prothrombin times. The remaining 9 infants were not tested. Another study in 13 women using doses of 2-12 mg also revealed no detectable warfarin in breast milk.[L6628] A woman who mistakenly took 25 mg of warfarin for 7 days while breastfeeding presented to an emergency room with an INR of 10 and prothrombin time of over 100 s. Her infant had a normal INR of 1.0 and prothrombin time of 10.3. The infant in this case has an increased prothrombin time of 33.8 s three weeks previous but this was judged not to be due to warfarin exposure."

This drug is unique from others in this class due to its rapid onset of effects and short duration of action.[A173842] Midazolam is available by oral, rectal, intranasal, intramuscular (IM), and intravenous (IV) routes and has been used in various biomedical applications, including dentistry, cardiac surgery, and endoscopic procedures as pre-anesthetic medication, and as an adjunct to local anesthesia.[F2977]

This drug was initially approved by the US FDA in 1985, and has been approved for various indications since.[FDA label] In late 2018, the intramuscular preparation was approved by the FDA for the treatment of status epilepticus in adults.[FDA label] In May 2019, the nasal spray of midazolam was approved for the acute treatment of distinctive intermittent, stereotypic seizure episodes in patients 12 years of age and older. Midazolam is considered a schedule IV drug in the United States due to the low potential for abuse and low risk of dependence.[L5074]","59467-70-8","R60L0SM5BC",325.767,325.078203343,"solid",2,7,1,3,NA,"**Intravenous**

Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine central nervous system (CNS) depressant. Pharmacodynamic properties of midazolam and its metabolites, which are similar to those of other benzodiazepine drugs, include sedative, anxiolytic, amnestic, muscle relaxant, as well as hypnotic activities.[F2434] Benzodiazepines enhance the inhibitory action of the amino acid neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).  Receptors for GABA are targeted by many important drugs that affect GABA function and are commonly used in the treatment of anxiety disorder, epilepsy, insomnia, spasticity, and aggressive behavior.[A173854]

**Sedation and memory**

The onset of sedation after intramuscular administration in adults is 15 minutes, with maximal sedation occurring 30-60 minutes after injection.[FDA label] In one study of adults, when tested the following day, 73% of the patients who were administered midazolam intramuscularly had no recollection of memory cards shown 30 minutes following drug administration; 40% had no recollection of the memory cards shown 60 minutes after drug administration. Onset time of sedative effects in pediatric patients begins within 5 minutes and peaks at 15-30 minutes depending upon the dose administered. In the pediatric population, up to 85% had no memory of pictures shown after receiving intramuscular midazolam compared to 5% of the placebo control group.[F2434]

Sedation in both adult and pediatric patients is reached within 3 to 5 minutes post intravenous (IV) injection. The time of onset is affected by the dose administered and the simultaneous administration of narcotic pre-medication. Seventy-one (71%) percent of the adult patients in clinical endoscopy studies had no memory of insertion of the endoscope; 82% of the patients had no memory of withdrawal of the endoscope.[FDA label]

**Anesthesia induction**

When midazolam is administered intravenously (IV) for anesthetic induction, induction of anesthesia occurs in about 1.5 minutes when narcotic pre-medication has been given and in 2 to 2.5 minutes without narcotic pre-medication/ other sedative pre-medication. Impairment in a memory test was observed in 90% of the patients.[FDA label]","The actions of benzodiazepines such as midazolam are mediated through the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Benzodiazepines increase the activity of GABA, thereby producing a sedating effect, relaxing skeletal muscles, and inducing sleep, anesthesia, and amnesia. Benzodiazepines bind to the benzodiazepine site on GABA-A receptors, which potentiates the effects of GABA by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening.[F2434] These receptors have been identified in different body tissues including the heart and skeletal muscle, although mainly appear to be present in the central nervous system.[A173842]","Midazolam is primarily metabolized in the liver and gut by CYP3A4 [FDA label] to its pharmacologic active metabolite, _alpha-hydroxymidazolam_ (also known as 1-hydroxy-midazolam), and 4-hydroxymidazolam (which makes up 5% or less of the biotransformation products). This metabolite likely contributes to the pharmacological effects of midazolam. Midazolam also undergoes N-glucuronidation via UGT1A4 after the process of hepatic oxidation by cytochrome enzymes.[A173842]

","**Oral Absorption**: Rapidly absorbed after oral administration.  The absolute bioavailability, if given intramuscularly (IM), is greater than 90% [FDA label]. Due to first pass metabolism, only 40-50% of the administered oral dose reaches the circulation.[A173842] The absolute bioavailability of the midazolam syrup in pediatric patients is about 36%.[L5092]

**Intramuscular Absorption**:  The mean peak concentration (Cmax) and time to peak (Tmax) following the IM dose was 90 ng/mL (20% CV) and 0.5 hour (50% CV).[FDA label]

**Rectal administration**: After rectal administration midazolam is absorbed rapidly. Maximum plasma concentration is reached within 30 minutes. The absolute bioavailability is approximately 50%.[F2977]


**Intranasal Administration**: Midazolam is absorbed rapidly after intranasal administration. Mean peak plasma concentrations are reached within 10.2 to 12.6 minutes. The bioavailability is between 55 and 57%.[F2977]
","**Intravenous**: healthy adults = 1.8 to 6.4 hours (mean of 3 hours).[F2434]

**Intramuscular**: Following IM administration of 10 mg midazolam, mean (±SD) elimination half-life was 4.2 (±1.87) hours.[FDA label]","Midazolam is approximately 97% bound to plasma protein, mainly albumin, in adults. The 1-hydroxy metabolite is approximately 89% bound to plasma protein.[F2434]","The _a-hydroxymidazolam_ glucuronide conjugate of midazolam is excreted in urine. No significant amount of parent drug or metabolites is found in urine before beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase deconjugation, suggesting that the urinary metabolites are excreted mainly as conjugates. The amount of midazolam excreted unchanged in the urine when given intravenously is less than 0.5%. 45% to 57% of the dose was excreted in the urine as 1-hydroxymethyl midazolam conjugate.[F2434]

Plasma clearance of midazolam is higher in patients that remain in supine position, because of a 40-60 percent increase in hepatic blood flow during supination. Pregnancy may also increase the metabolism of midazolam.[A173842]","Female gender, old age, and obesity may increase the volume of distribution.

**Overdose**

Signs of overdose include sedation, somnolence, confusion, impaired coordination, diminished reflexes, coma, and deleterious effects on vital signs.  Serious cardiorespiratory adverse reactions have occurred, sometimes ending in death or permanent neurologic effects, after the administration of midazolam.[FDA label]

**A note on cardiac and respiratory depression**

After administration of midazolam, continuous monitoring of respiratory and cardiac function is recommended until the patient is in stable condition. Serious and life-threatening cardiorespiratory adverse reactions, including hypoventilation, airway obstruction, apnea, and hypotension have been reported with the use of midazolam. Patients should be monitored in a setting with immediate access to resuscitative drugs if they are required. Resuscitation equipment and personnel trained in their use and skilled in airway management should be available when midazolam is administered.[FDA label]

The usual recommended intramuscular pre-medicating doses of midazolam do not depress the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation to a clinically significant extent in adults. Intravenous induction doses of midazolam depress the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation for at least 15 minutes longer than the duration of ventilatory depression following administration of thiopental in adults. Impairment of ventilatory response to carbon dioxide is more severe in adult patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).[F2434]

**A note on dependence**

When midazolam is used in long-term sedation in the ICU (intensive care unit) or other settings, physical dependence on midazolam may develop. The risk of dependence increases with dose and duration of treatment; this risk is also greater in patients with a medical history of substance abuse.[L5074]

**Special caution should be exercised when administering midazolam in the following populations** 

High-risk patients include adults over 60 years of age, chronically ill or debilitated patients, which may include patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency, patients with chronic renal failure, impaired hepatic function or with impaired cardiac function, pediatric patients (especially those with cardiovascular instability). These high-risk patients require lower dosages and should be monitored on a continuous basis for early signs of alterations of vital functions, so that appropriate management may be administered.[L5074]

**Mutagenesis**

Midazolam was negative for genotoxicity during in vitro and in vivo assays.[FDA label]

**Impairment of Fertility**

When midazolam (0, 1, 4, or 16 mg/kg) was given orally to male and female rats before and during mating and continuing in females throughout gestation and lactation, no adverse effects on male or female fertility were observed. Midazolam plasma exposures (AUC) at the highest dose tested were approximately 6 times that in humans at the recomended human dose.[FDA label]"

Mycophenolate mofetil should be used concomitantly with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.","Mycophenolate mofetil is a prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA), an antibiotic substance derived from <i>Penicillium stoloniferum</i>. It blocks de novo biosynthesis of purine nucleotides by inhibition of the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. Mycophenolic acid is important because of its selective effects on the immune system. It prevents the proliferation of T-cells, lymphocytes, and the formation of antibodies from B-cells. It also may inhibit recruitment of leukocytes to inflammatory sites.","Mycophenolate mofetil is hydrolyzed to form mycophenolic acid (MPA), which is the active metabolite. MPA is a potent, selective, uncompetitive, and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), and therefore inhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into DNA. Because T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation on de novo synthesis of purines, whereas other cell types can utilize salvage pathways, MPA has potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes. MPA inhibits proliferative responses of T- and B-lymphocytes to both mitogenic and allospecific stimulation. Addition of guanosine or deoxyguanosine reverses the cytostatic effects of MPA on lymphocytes. MPA also suppresses antibody formation by B-lymphocytes. MPA prevents the glycosylation of lymphocyte and monocyte glycoproteins that are involved in intercellular adhesion to endothelial cells and may inhibit recruitment of leukocytes into sites of inflammation and graft rejection. Mycophenolate mofetil did not inhibit early events in the activation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, such as the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-2 (IL-2), but did block the coupling of these events to DNA synthesis and proliferation.","Following oral and intravenous dosing, mycophenolate mofetil undergoes complete metabolism to MPA, the active metabolite. Metabolism to MPA occurs presystemically after oral dosing. MPA is metabolized principally by glucuronyl transferase to form the phenolic glucuronide of MPA (MPAG) which is not pharmacologically active. In vivo, MPAG is converted to MPA via enterohepatic recirculation. The following metabolites of the 2-hydroxyethyl-morpholino moiety are also recovered in the urine following oral administration of mycophenolate mofetil to healthy subjects: N-(2-carboxymethyl)-morpholine, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholine, and the N-oxide of N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholine. Cytochrome P450 isozymes, CYP3A4/5 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8, is responsible for the biotransformation of MPA to 6-O-desmethyl-mycophenolic acid.","Rapidly absorbed following oral administration. In 12 healthy volunteers, the mean absolute bioavailability of oral mycophenolate mofetil relative to intravenous mycophenolate mofetil (based on MPA AUC) was 94%. The absolute bioavailability of the delayed release tablet in stable renal transplant patients on cyclosporin is 72%. Food (27 g fat, 650 calories) has no effect on the extent of absorption (MPA AUC) of mycophenolate mofetil.","The mean elimination half-life for mycophenolic acid (the active metabolite) ranges from 8-16 hours, while that of the MPAG metabolite ranges from 13-17 hours.","MPA (the active metabolite), at clinically relevant concentrations, is over 98% bound to plasma albumin. The phenolic glucuronide of MPA, mycophenolic acid glucuronide  (MPAG) has 82% protein bound.","Negligible amount of drug is excreted as MPA (< 1% of dose) in the urine. When orally administered, mycophenolate mofetil was completely recovered with 93% of the dose found in the urine and 6% found in feces. 87% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG.","* 3.6 ±1.5 L/kg [intravenous, healthy subjects, MPA]

It is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). It works by relaxing blood vessels, causing them to widen. Lowering high blood pressure helps prevent strokes, heart attacks and kidney problems.","Moexipril is a prodrug for moexiprilat, which inhibits ACE in humans and animals. The mechanism through which moexiprilat lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily inhibition of ACE activity. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent peripheral vasoconstrictor that also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex and provides negative feedback on renin secretion. ACE is identical to kininase II, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator. Moexiprilat is about 1000 times as potent as moexipril in inhibiting ACE and kininase II. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased angiotensin II formation, leading to decreased vasoconstriction, increased plasma renin activity, and decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter results in diuresis and natriuresis and a small increase in serum potassium concentration (mean increases of about 0.25 mEq/L were seen when moexipril was used alone). Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of moexipril remains to be elucidated. Although the principal mechanism of moexipril in blood pressure reduction is believed to be through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, ACE inhibitors have some effect on blood pressure even in apparent low-renin hypertension.","Rapidly converted to moexiprilat, the active metabolite.

It increases blood flow to the skin, mucosa and abdominal viscera, and lowers both supine and erect blood pressures. It has no effect on the parasympathetic system. Phentolamine works by blocking alpha receptors in certain parts of the body. Alpha receptors are present in the muscle that lines the walls of blood vessels. When the receptors are blocked by Phentolamine, the muscle relaxes and the blood vessels widen. This widening of the blood vessels results in a lowering of blood pressure.","Phentolamine produces its therapeutic actions by competitively blocking alpha-adrenergic receptors (primarily excitatory responses of smooth muscle and exocrine glands), leading to a muscle relaxation and a widening of the blood vessels. This widening of the blood vessels results in a lowering of blood pressure. The action of phentolamine on the alpha adrenergic receptors is relatively transient and the blocking effect is incomplete.

The general recommendation is to reserve tizanidine use for periods of time when there is a particular need for relief, as it has a short duration of action [FDA label, F4471].","**A note on spasticity**

Spasticity is an increase in muscle accompanied by uncontrolled, repetitive contractions of skeletal muscles which are involuntary.
The patient suffering from muscle spasticity may have reduced mobility and high levels of pain, contributing to poor quality of life and problems performing activities of personal hygiene and care [A177640]. 

**General effects**

Tizanidine is a rapidly acting drug used for the relief of muscle spasticity when it is required for performing specific activities. It acts as an agonist at Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor sites and relieves symptoms of muscle spasticity, allowing the continuation of normal daily activities. In animal models, tizanidine has not been shown to exert direct effects on skeletal muscle fibers or the neuromuscular junction, and has shown no significant effect on monosynaptic spinal reflexes (consisting of the communication between only 1 sensory neuron and 1 motor neuron) [L6064]. The frequency of muscle spasm and clonus are shown to be decreased by tizanidine [T574]. Tizanidine shows a stronger action on polysynaptic reflexes, which involve several interneurons (relay neurons) communicating with motor neurons stimulating muscle movement [L6064].

**Effects on blood pressure and heart rate**

This drug decreases heart rate and blood pressure in humans [A177559, A177589].  Despite this, rebound hypertension and tachycardia along with increased spasticity can occur when tizanidine is abruptly discontinued [A177643].","Tizanidine reduces spasticity by causing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons via agonist actions at Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor sites.
This drug is centrally acting and leads to a reduction in the release of excitatory amino acids like glutamate and aspartate, which cause neuronal firing that leads to muscle spasm. The above reduction and excitatory neurotransmitter release results in presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The strongest effect of tizanidine has been shown to occur on spinal polysynaptic pathways.   The anti-nociceptive and anticonvulsant activities of tizanidine may also be attributed to agonist action on Alpha-2 receptors.  Tizanidine also binds with weaker affinity to the Alpha-1 receptors, explaining its slight and temporary effect on the cardiovascular system [T574].","About 95% of the ingested dose of tizanidine is metabolized. The main enzyme involved in the hepatic metabolism of tizanidine is CYP1A2 [FDA label].","This drug undergoes significant first-pass metabolism. After the administration of an oral dose, tizanidine is mostly absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is measured to be about 40% [FDA label]. 

**Effect of food on absorption**

Food has been shown to increase absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase in absorption with the tablet (about 30%) was noticeably higher than the capsule (~10%). When the capsule and tablet were administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet [FDA label]. It is therefore advisable to take this drug with food for increased absorption, especially in tablet form.","Approximately 2.5 hours [FDA label].","About 30% bound to plasma proteins [FDA label].","This drug is mainly eliminated by the kidney [FDA label].","Extensively distributed throughout the body. The average steady-state volume of distribution is 2.4 L/kg [FDA label].","
**A note on renal impairment**

Tizanidine clearance is found to be decreased by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min)

**Use in pregnancy**

Animal studies have determined that this drug causes fetal harm [FDA label]. Studies have not been performed in humans, and it is advisable to ensure that tizanidine use in pregnant women should be reserved for cases in which possible benefit clearly outweighs the possible risk to mother and unborn child [F4471]. 

**Use in breastfeeding**

In studies of rat models, this tizanidine was found excreted in the breastmilk with a milk-to-blood ratio of 1.8:1 [FDA label]. In young nursing rats, abnormal results were obtained in tests indicative of central nervous system function. Various developmental changes that may have been attributable to the drug were observed.  It is unknown whether tizanidine is excreted in human milk. It is a lipid-soluble drug, however, and likely to be excreted into breast milk [F4471]. 

**Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis**

No signs of carcinogenicity were observed in two dietary studies performed in rodent models. Tizanidine was given to mice for 78 weeks at doses reaching a maximum 16 mg/kg (equivalent to twice the maximum recommended human dose). In addition, the drug was given to rats for 104 weeks at doses reaching 9 mg/kg (equivalent to 2.5 times the maximum recommended human dose). There was a lack of a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of tumors in either study group [F4471].

Tizanidine was not found to be mutagenic or clastogenic in several laboratory essays, including the bacterial Ames test, the mammalian gene mutation test, in addition to the chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster cells and several other assays [F4471].

[FDA label]","**Effect on the Central Nervous System (CNS)**

 In clinical settings, sufentanil exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary therapeutic actions are analgesia and sedation. Sufentanil may increase pain tolerance and decrease the perception of pain. This drug depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils [F2009], [A39637]. When used in balanced general anesthesia, sufentanil has been reported to be as much as 10 times as potent as fentanyl. When administered intravenously as a primary anesthetic agent with 100% oxygen, sufentanil is approximately 5 to 7 times as potent as fentanyl [FDA label]. High doses of intravenous sufentanil have been shown to cause muscle rigidity, likely as a result of an effect on the substantia nigra and the striate nucleus in the brain. Sleep-inducing (hypnotic) activity can be demonstrated by EEG alterations [FDA label].

**Effects on the Respiratory System**

Sufentanil may cause respiratory depression [FDA label].

**Effects on the Cardiovascular System**

Sufentanil causes peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Bradycardia may also occur [F2009]. Clinical signs or symptoms of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension [FDA label].

**Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract**

Sufentanil causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in both the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine may be delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased and lead to spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, as well as temporary elevations in serum amylase [FDA label].","Sufentanil is a synthetic, potent opioid with highly selective binding to µ-opioid receptors [F2009]. These receptors are widely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues [A39636], [A39637].

In general, opioids decrease cAMP (affecting neural signaling pathways), decrease neurotransmitter release, and cause membrane hyperpolarization, all of which contribute to the relief of painful symptoms [A39637].

Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic neural transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate receptor leads to the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP, located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. The release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline is then inhibited [A39637]. 

Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist), also preventing neurotransmitter release [A39637].

Sufentanil and other opioids open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels, resulting in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability [A39636], [A39637].","The liver and small intestine are the major sites of biotransformation [FDA label].
Sufentanil is rapidly metabolized to a number of inactive metabolites, with oxidative N- and O-dealkylation being the major routes of elimination [F2009].","Bioavailability of a single sublingual tablet was 52%, decreasing to 35% with repeat dosing [A39629].

After epidural administration of incremental doses totaling 5 to 40 mcg sufentanil during labor and delivery, maternal and neonatal sufentanil plasma concentrations were at or near the 0.05 to 0.1 ng/mL limit of detection, and were slightly higher in mothers than in their infants [FDA label].
","The elimination half-life is 164 minutes in adults when administered intravenously (IV). The elimination half-life of sufentanil is shorter (e.g. 97 +/- 42 minutes) in infants and children, and longer in neonates (e.g. 434 +/- 160 minutes) compared to that of adolescents and adults [FDA label].

After a single administration of a 15 microgram sufentanil sublingual tablet, mean terminal phase half-lives in the range of 6-10 hours have been observed. After multiple administrations, a longer average terminal half-life of up to 18 hours was measured, owing to the higher plasma concentrations of sufentanil achieved after repeated dosing and due to the possibility to quantify these concentrations over a longer time period [F2009].

","Plasma protein binding of sufentanil, related to the alpha acid glycoprotein concentration, was approximately 93% in healthy males, 91% in mothers and 79% in neonates [FDA label].","Approximately 80% of the administered dose is excreted within 24 hours and only 2% of the dose is eliminated as unchanged drug [FDA label].","Sufentanil has a distribution time of 1.4 minutes and redistribution time of 17.1 minutes [FDA label].
The central volume of distribution after intravenous application of sufentanil is approximately 14 L and the volume of distribution at steady state is approximately 350 L [F2009].","The total plasma clearance after single intravenous administration is about 917 l/min [F2009].

The clearance of sufentanil in healthy neonates is approximately one-half that in adults and children. The clearance rate of sufentanil can be further reduced by up to a third in neonates with cardiovascular disease [FDA label].","ChronogesicDURECTDisufenAngenericoFastfenCristáliaSufenta ForteJanssenSufenta miteJanssenSufentilClaris Lifesciences Ltd.ZuftilPisa",0,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00708.pdf?1541440044","//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00708.pdf?1265922745",0,1482,"**LD<sub>50</sub>:** 18.7 mg/kg (IV in mice) [MSDS]

**A Note on Respiratory Depression**

Major, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even in cases where it is used as recommended. Respiratory depression may lead to respiratory arrest and death if not diagnosed and treated appropriately. This drug should be administered only by persons specifically trained in the use of anesthetic drugs and the management of the respiratory effects of potent opioids, including respiration and cardiac resuscitation of patients in the age group being treated. This training must include the establishment and maintenance of a patent airway and assisted ventilation [FDA label].

**Carcinogenesis**
Long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of sufentanil have not been conducted [FDA label].

**Mutagenesis**
Sufentanil was not found to be genotoxic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay) or in the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleous assay [FDA label].

**Reproductive Toxicity**

Sufentanil caused embryolethality in rats and rabbits treated for 10-30 days during pregnancy with 2.5 times the maximum human dose by intravenous administration. The embryolethal effect was thought to be secondary to the toxicity for the mother animal model. No negative effects were noted in another study in rats that were treated with 20 times the maximum human dose in the period of organogenesis. The preclinical effects were only seen following administrations of levels significantly above the maximum human dose, which is therefore of minimal relevance for clinical use [F2009].

**Pregnancy**

May cause fetal harm [FDA label]

**The Use in Lactation**

Infants exposed to this drug through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression [FDA label]."

They have little to no effect on norepinephrine or dopamine reuptake and do not antagonize <U+237A>- or ß-adrenergic, dopamine D<sub>2</sub> or histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors. During acute use, SSRIs block serotonin reuptake and increase serotonin stimulation of somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and terminal autoreceptors. Chronic use leads to desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and terminal autoreceptors. The overall clinical effect of increased mood and decreased anxiety is thought to be due to adaptive changes in neuronal function that leads to enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission. 

Side effects include dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, sexual dysfunction and headache (see Toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects). Side effects generally occur during the first two weeks of therapy and are usually less severe and frequent than those observed with tricyclic antidepressants. Paroxetine hydrochloride and mesylate are considered therapeutic alternatives rather than generic equivalents by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); both agents contain the same active moiety (i.e. paroxetine), but are formulated as different salt forms. Clinical studies establishing the efficacy of paroxetine in various conditions were performed using paroxetine hydrochloride. Since both agents contain the same active moiety, the clinical efficacy of both agents is thought to be similar. Paroxetine may be used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social anxiety disorder (social phobia), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Paroxetine has the most evidence supporting its use for anxiety-related disorders of the SSRIs. It has the greatest anticholinergic activity of the agents in this class and compared to other SSRIs, paroxetine may cause greater weight gain, sexual dysfunction, sedation and constipation.","61869-08-7","41VRH5220H",329.3654,329.142721716,"solid",2,5,0,0,"Charles M.

In human platelets, paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin. It has weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake.

Paroxetine likely inhibits the reuptake of serotonin at the neuronal membrane, enhances serotonergic neurotransmission by reducing turnover of the neurotransmitter, therefore it prolongs its activity at synaptic receptor sites and potentiates 5-HT in the CNS; paroxetine is more potent than both sertraline and fluoxetine in its ability to inhibit 5-HT reuptake.

May be used in conjunction with thrombolytic agents, aspirin and/or &beta;-blockers to improve survival in hemodynamically stable individuals following myocardial infarction. May be used to slow the progression of renal disease in hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria or overt nephropathy.","Lisinopril is an orally active ACE inhibitor that antagonizes the effect of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may further sustain the effects of lisinopril by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.","There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Lisinopril, one of the few ACE inhibitors that is not a prodrug, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Lisinopril also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors.","Does not undergo metabolism, excreted unchanged in urine.","Approximately 25%, but widely variable between individuals (6 to 60%) in all doses tested (5-80 mg); absorption is unaffected by food","Effective half life of accumulation following multiple dosing is 12 hours.","Lisinopril does not appear to be bound to serum proteins other than ACE.","Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine.",NA,"* 10 L/h [child weighting 30 kg receiving doses of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg]","AcebitorGlaxoSmithKlineAceminAstraZenecaAcerbonAstraZenecaAcinoprilsanofi-aventisBellisinRanbaxyBioprilBiochemDaprilMedochemieFibsolSigmaFisoprilSanofi-AventisHiprilMicro LabsLinoprilKlinger (Brazil)LisiprilHexal (Czech Republic), Orion (Finland)NopertenDexa (Indonesia)PresitenMagnachemRanolipRanbaxyRanoprilRanbaxyRantexBiotechSinoprenRanbaxySinoprilEczacibasi (Russia)TensoprilMerck",4,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00722.pdf?1265922810",NA,4,1330,"Symptoms of overdose include severe hypotension, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure.

At that site, ACh normally produces electrical depolarization of the postjunctional membrane of motor end-plate, which leads to conduction of muscle action potential and subsequently induces skeletal muscle contraction. Neuromuscular agents are classified as depolarizing or nondepolarizing. Rocuronium is a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with a rapid to intermediate onset depending on dose and intermediate duration. Rocuronium, like vecuronium is longer acting in infants than in children. However, unlike vecuronium, rocuronium retains the characteristics of an intermediate-acting NMBD in infants.","Rocuronium acts by competing for cholinergic receptors at the motor end-plate. This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine and edrophonium. Rocuronium acts by competitively binding to nicotinic cholinergic receptors. The binding of vecuronium decreases the opportunity for acetylcholine to bind to the nicotinic receptor at the postjunctional membrane of the myoneural junction. As a result, depolarization is prevented, calcium ions are not released and muscle contraction does not occur. Evidence also suggests that nondepolarizing agents can affect ACh release. It has been hypothesized that nondepolarzing agents bind to postjunctional (""curare"") receptors and may therefore interfere with the sodium and potassium flux, which is responsible for depolarization and repolarization of the membranes involved in muscle contraction.","Rocuronium is metabolized to a less active metabolite, 17-desacetyl-rocuronium, and is eliminated primarily by the liver.","Poorly absorbed from the GI tract.","The rapid distribution half-life is 1-2 minutes and the slower distribution half-life is 14-18 minutes.

Nateglinide is an amino acid derivative that induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those naïve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones.

Membrane potential is regulated through an inverse relationship between the activity of cell membrane ATP-sensitive potassium channels (ABCC8) and extracellular glucose concentrations. Extracellular glucose enters the cell via GLUT2 (SLC2A2) transporters. Once inside the cell, glucose is metabolized to produce ATP. High concentrations of ATP inhibit ATP-sensitive potassium channels causing membrane depolarization. When extracellular glucose concentrations are low, ATP-sensitive potassium channels open causing membrane repolarization. High glucose concentrations cause ATP-sensitive potassium channels to close resulting in membrane depolarization and opening of L-type calcium channels. The influx of calcium ions stimulates calcium-dependent exocytosis of insulin granules. Nateglinide increases insulin release by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels in a glucose-dependent manner.","Nateglinide activity is dependent on the presence functioning ß cells and glucose. In contrast to sulfonylurea insulin secretatogogues, nateglinide has no effect on insulin release in the absence of glucose. Rather, it potentiates the effect of extracellular glucose on ATP-sensitive potassium channel and has little effect on insulin levels between meals and overnight. As such, nateglinide is more effective at reducing postprandial blood glucose levels than fasting blood glucose levels and requires a longer duration of therapy (approximately one month) before decreases in fasting blood glucose are observed. The insulinotropic effects of nateglinide are highest at intermediate glucose levels (3 to 10 mmol/L) and it does not increase insulin release already stimulated by high glucose concentrations (greater than 15 mmol/L).

A reduction in extrapyramidal symptoms in Risperidone use is attributed to its moderate affinity for dopaminergic D2 receptors [A1119, L1212, A1117].  

","Though its mechanism of action is not fully understood at this time, current focus is on the ability of risperidone to inhibit the D2 dopaminergic receptors and 5-HT2A serotonergic receptors in the brain. Schizophrenia is thought to be caused by an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively [A1115, A1116, A1117]. 

D2 dopaminergic receptors are transiently inhibited by risperidone, reducing dopaminergic neurotransmission, therefore decreasing positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as delusions and hallucinations. Risperidone binds transiently and with loose affinity to the dopaminergic D2 receptor, with an ideal receptor occupancy of 60-70% for optimal effect [A1119, A31773]. Rapid dissociation of risperidone from the D2 receptors contributes to decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which occur with permanent and high occupancy blockade of D2 dopaminergic receptors [A1118, A1119]. Low affinity binding and rapid dissociation from the D2 receptor distinguish risperidone from the traditional antipsychotic drugs. A higher occupancy rate of D2 receptors is said to increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and is therefore to be avoided [A1118, A1119, A31771]. 
 
Increased serotonergic mesocortical activity in schizophrenia results in negative symptoms, such as depression and decreased motivation [L1212, L1213]. The high affinity binding of risperidone to 5-HT2A receptors leads to a decrease in serotonergic activity. In addition, 5-HT2A receptor blockade results in decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, likely by increasing dopamine release from the frontal cortex, and not the nigrostriatal tract. Dopamine level is              
therefore not completely inhibited [A1117, A1119]. Through the above mechanisms, both serotonergic and D2 blockade by risperidone are thought to synergistically work to decrease the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. 
 
Risperidone has also been said to be an antagonist of alpha-1 (a1) alpha-2 (a2) receptors, and histamine (H1) receptors [L1212]. Blockade of these receptors is thought to improve symptoms of schizophrenia, however the exact mechanism of action on these receptors is not fully understood at this time [L1212, L1213].","Extensively metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 2D6 isozyme to 9-hydroxyrisperidone, which has approximately the same receptor binding affinity as risperidone [A1118, A31772]. Hydroxylation is dependent on debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase and metabolism is sensitive to genetic polymorphisms in debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase [A11119, A31772]. Risperidone also undergoes N-dealkylation to a lesser extent [A1119, A31772].","Well absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of risperidone is 70% (CV=25%).

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell.

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health.

","Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack antisecretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite. CYP2C19 isoenzyme exhibits polymorphism in the metabolism of esomeprazole, since some 3% of Caucasians and 15 to 20% of Asians lack CYP2C19 and are termed Poor Metabolizers [FDA Label]. However, the influence of CYP 2C19 polymorphism is less pronounced for esomeprazole than for omeprazole[F4495]. At steady state, the ratio of AUC in Poor Metabolizers to AUC in the rest of the population (Extensive Metabolizers) is approximately 2.

Following administration of equimolar doses, the S- and R-isomers are metabolized differently by the liver, resulting in higher plasma levels of the S- than of the R-isomer [FDA Label]. 

Nine major urinary metabolites have been detected. The two main metabolites have been identified as hydroxyesomeprazole and the corresponding carboxylic acid. Three major metabolites have been identified in plasma: the 5-O-desmethyl- and sulphone derivatives and hydroxyesomeprazole. The major metabolites of esomeprazole have no effect on gastric acid secretion[F4495].","After oral administration, peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once-daily dosing with 40 mg, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose of 40 mg. The mean exposure (AUC) to esomeprazole increases from 4.32 µmol*hr/L on Day 1 to 11.2 µmol*hr/L on Day 5 after 40 mg once daily dosing.

Technically, the term corticosteroid refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, but is often used as a synonym for glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids suppress cell-mediated immunity. They act by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, the most important of which is the IL-2. Reduced cytokine production limits T cell proliferation. Glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity, causing B cells to express lower amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors. This diminishes both B cell clonal expansion and antibody synthesis. The diminished amounts of IL-2 also leads to fewer T lymphocyte cells being activated.","Hydrocortisone binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.","Primarily hepatic via CYP3A4","Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin.

It is also used to treat or prevent medical conditions that are caused by an increase in body fluids/water (e.g., cerebral edema, glaucoma, kidney failure).

Paramagnetic agents have unpaired electrons that generate a magnetic field about 700 times larger than the proton's field, thus disturbing the proton's local magnetic field. When the local magnetic field around a proton is disturbed, its relaxation process is altered. MR images are based on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. MR instruments can record 2 different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and the T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visualization of normal and pathological brain tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in the T2. When placed in a magnetic field, Gadobenate Dimeglumine shortens both the T1 and the T2 relaxation times in tissues where it accumulates.

Tranylcypromine is a non-hydrazine monoamine oxidase inhibitor with a rapid onset of activity. MAO is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of a number of amines, including serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. Two isoforms of MAO, A and B, are found in the body. MAO-A is mainly found within cells located in the periphery and catalyzes the breakdown of serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine and tyramine. MAO-B acts on phenylethylamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine and tyramine, is localized extracellularly and is found predominantly in the brain. While the mechanism of MAOIs is still unclear, it is thought that they act by increasing free serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations and/or by altering the concentrations of other amines in the CNS. It has been postulated that depression is caused by low levels of serotonin and/or norepinephrine and that increasing serotonergic and norepinephrinergic neurotransmission results in relief of depressive symptoms. MAO A inhibition is thought to be more relevant to antidepressant activity than MAO B inhibition. Selective MAO B inhibitors, such as selegiline, have no antidepressant effects.","Tranylcypromine irreversibly and nonselectively inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO). Within neurons, MAO appears to regulate the levels of monoamines released upon synaptic firing. Since depression is associated with low levels of monoamines, the inhibition of MAO serves to ease depressive symptoms, as this results in an increase in the concentrations of these amines within the CNS.","Hepatic.","Interindividual variability in absorption.

Comedones form in follicles with an excess of keratinized epithelial cells. Tretinoin promotes detachment of cornified cells and the enhanced shedding of corneocytes from the follicle. By increasing the mitotic activity of follicular epithelia, tretinoin also increases the turnover rate of thin, loosely-adherent corneocytes. Through these actions, the comedo contents are extruded and the formation of the microcomedo, the precursor lesion of acne vulgaris, is reduced. Tretinoin is not a cytolytic agent but instead induces cytodifferentiation and decreased proliferation of APL cells in culture and in vivo.

Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity, the transmission of nerve impulses, the contraction of cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle, and the maintenance of normal renal function. The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter. The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane. Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and under steady-state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day. Potassium depletion will occur whenever the rate of potassium loss through renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract exceeds the rate of potassium intake. Such depletion usually develops as a consequence of therapy with diuretics, primarily or secondary hyperaldosteronism, diabetic ketoacidosis, or inadequate replacement of potassium in patients on prolonged parenteral nutrition. Depletion can develop rapidly with severe diarrhea, especially if associated with vomiting. Potassium depletion due to these causes is usually accompanied by concomitant loss of chloride and is manifested by hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Potassium depletion may produce weakness, fatigue, disturbances of cardiac rhythm (primarily ectopic beats), prominent U-waves in the electrocardiogram, and, in advanced cases, flaccid paralysis and/or impaired ability to concentrate urine. If potassium depletion associated with metabolic alkalosis cannot be managed by correcting the fundamental cause of the deficiency, e.g., where the patient requires long-term diuretic therapy, supplemental potassium in the form of high potassium food or potassium chloride may be able to restore normal potassium levels. In rare circumstances (e.g., patients with renal tubular acidosis) potassium depletion may be associated with metabolic acidosis and hyperchloremia. In such patients, potassium replacement should be accomplished with potassium salts other than the chloride, such as potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate, potassium acetate, or potassium gluconate.","Supplemental potassium in the form of high potassium food or potassium chloride may be able to restore normal potassium levels.",NA,"Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and under steady-state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine.",NA,NA,"Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and, under steady-state conditions, the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine.

Also used in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy.","Irinotecan is an antineoplastic enzyme inhibitor primarily used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Irinotecan is a semisynthetic derivative of camptothecin. Camptothecins interact specifically with topoisomerase I, an enzyme in the cell nucleus that regulates DNA topology and facilitates nuclear processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and repair. During these processes, topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks, allowing single DNA strands to pass through the break. The 3'-DNA terminus of the broken DNA strands bind covalently with the topoisomerase enzyme to form a catalytic intermediate called a cleavable complex. After the DNA is sufficiently relaxed and the strand passage reaction is complete, DNA topoisomerase reattaches the broken DNA strands to form the chemically unaltered topoisomers that allow transcription to proceed. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either Irinotecan or SN-38. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double-strand breaks. The precise contribution of SN-38 to the activity of irinotecan in humans is not known. Irinotecan is cell cycle phase-specific (S-phase).","Irinotecan inhibits the action of topoisomerase I. Irinotecan prevents religation of the DNA strand by binding to topoisomerase I-DNA complex. The formation of this ternary complex interferes with the moving replication fork, which induces replication arrest and lethal double-stranded breaks in DNA. As a result, DNA damage is not efficiently repaired and apoptosis (programmed cell death) occurs.","Hepatic. The metabolic conversion of irinotecan to the active metabolite SN-38 is mediated by carboxylesterase enzymes and primarily occurs in the liver.

As a mast cell stabilizer, it stabilizes rodent basophils and human conjunctival mast cells and inhibits the immunologically-stimulated release of histamine.[A179704] Olopatadine acts as an antagonist at the histamine H1 receptors with high selectivity, which is explained by a unique receptor binding pocket that consists of the aspartate residue in the third transmembrane helix and other sites in the H1 receptor.[A1170] Upon binding, olopatadine blocks the H1 receptor signaling pathway, inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators, such as tryptase, prostaglandin D2, TNF-alpha, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines.[L6790] It also decreases chemotaxis and inhibits eosinophil activation.[L6781] _In vitro_, olopatadine was shown to inhibit epithelial cell intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which promotes the recruitment of migrating pro-inflammatory mediators.[A179704]","Olopatadine undergoes hepatic metabolism in a non-extensive manner.[L6784,L6787] Based on oral pharmacokinetic studies, there are at least 6 circulating metabolites in human plasma.[L6784] Following topical ocular application of olopatadine, olopatadine N-oxide is formed by metabolism catalyzed by flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) 1 and 3 [L6784] and was detected in the plasma after 4 hours post-dosing in less than 10% of the total plasma in half of the patients.[L6781] Mono-desmethyl olopatadine, or N-desmethyl olopatadine, is formed by CYP3A4 [L6784] and may be detected in minimal levels.[L6781]","Ocular administration of olopatadine in healthy subjects resulted in the Cmax of 1.6 ± 0.9 ng/mL, which was reached after about 2.0 hours.

The average absolute bioavaiability of intranasal olopatadine is about 57%. Following intranasal administration in healthy subjects, the Cmax of 6.0 ± 8.99 ng/mL at steady-state was reached between 30 minutes to 1 hour after twice daily intranasal administration.

Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones characterised by an ability to bind with the cortisol receptor and trigger a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic effects. Glucocorticoids are distinguished from mineralocorticoids and sex steroids by having different receptors, target cells, and effects. Technically, the term corticosteroid refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, but is often used as a synonym for glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids suppress cell-mediated immunity. They act by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, the most important of which is the IL-2. Reduced cytokine production limits T cell proliferation. Glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity, causing B cells to express lower amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors. This diminishes both B cell clonal expansion and antibody synthesis. The diminished amounts of IL-2 also leads to fewer T lymphocyte cells being activated.","Hydrocortamate binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. The immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.","Primarily hepatic via CYP3A4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EtacortAngeliniMagnacortPfizerUlcortUlcort top",0,NA,NA,0,161,"Side effects include burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, miliaria."

This is because, as a form of prostaglandinE1 (PGE1) it has multiple effects on blood flow. This results in increased pulmonary or systemic blood flow in infants. In cyanotic congenital heart disease, alprostadil's actions result in an increased oxygen supply to the tissues. In infants with interrupted aortic arch or very severe aortic coarctation, alprostadil maintains distal aortic perfusion by permitting blood flow through the DA from the pulmonary artery to the aorta. In infants with aortic coarctation, alprostadil reduces aortic obstruction either by relaxing ductus tissue in the aortic wall or by increasing effective aortic diameter by dilating the DA. In infants with these aortic arch anomalies, systemic blood flow to the lower body is increased, improving tissue oxygen supply and renal perfusion. When administered by intracavernosal injection or as an intraurethral suppository, alprostadil acts locally to relax the trabecular smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa and the cavernosal arteries. Swelling, elongation, and rigidity of the penis result when arterial blood rapidly flows into the corpus cavernosum to expand the lacunar spaces.

Atypical depression has a high prevalence rate, starts in early life, tends to last longer, is more likely to occur in people with bipolar disorder, has a high comorbidity with anxiety disorder and carries more risk of suicidal behavior. It is important to specify the atypical feature to predict the clinical course of depression and hence generate the best treatment and service. The featuring symptoms of the atypical feature include mood reactivity, two or more of this symptoms: 1) increased appetite, 2) increased sleep, 3) leaden paralysis and 4) interpersonal rejection sensitivity and should not have melancholic or catatonic features of depression.[A31917]

Neurotic depression is a depression of an emotionally unstable person. It is a secondary condition to major personality disorder, neuroses and drug use disorders. Likewise, a primary depression with a family history of depression spectrum disease would fit in this category.[A31922]

"DB00783","APRD00311","small molecule",2005-06-13,2019-07-02,"Estradiol","Estradiol (also known as E2 or 17ß-estradiol) is a naturally occurring hormone that circulates endogenously within the human body. It is the most potent form of mammalian estrogenic steroids and acts as the major female sex hormone. As such, estradiol plays an essential role in the regulation of the menstrual cycle, in the development of puberty and secondary female sex characteristics, as well as in ageing and several hormonally-mediated disease states. Estrogen mediates its effects across the body through potent agonism of the Estrogen Receptor (ER), which is located in various tissues including in the breasts, uterus, ovaries, skin, prostate, bone, fat, and brain. Estradiol binds to both subtypes of the Estrogen Receptor: Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERa) and Estrogen Receptor Beta (ERß). Estradiol also acts as a potent agonist of G Protein-coupled Estrogen Receptor (GPER), which has recently been recognized as a major mediator of estradiol's rapid cellular effects [A31620]. 

Estradiol is commercially available in several hormone therapy products for managing conditions associated with reduced estrogen production such as menopausal and peri-menopausal symptoms as well as hypoestrogenism. It is also used in transgender hormone therapy, as a component of oral contraceptive pills for preventing pregnancy (most commonly as [DB00977], a synthetic form of estradiol), and is sometimes used for the palliative treatment of some hormone-sensitive cancers like breast and prostate cancer. Estradiol is available in a number of formulations including oral, transdermal, and injectable. 

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. However, after menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulphate conjugated form, estrone sulphate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women [FDA Label]. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol at the receptor level. Because of the difference in potency between estradiol and estrone, menopause (and a change in primary hormone from estradiol to estrone) is associated with a number of symptoms associated with this reduction in potency and in estrogenic effects. These include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, mood changes, irregular menses, chills, and sleeping problems.

When used for oral or IM administration, estradiol is commonly synthesized as a pro-drug ester (such as [DB13952], [DB13953], [DB13954], [DB13955], and [DB13956]). It is commonly produced with an ester side-chain as endogenous estradiol has very low oral bioavailability on its own (2-10%). First-pass metabolism by the gut and the liver quickly degrades the estradiol molecule before it gets a chance to enter the systemic circulation and exert its estrogenic effects [A12102]. Esterification of estradiol aims to improve absorption after oral administration (such as with Estradiol valerate) or to sustain release from intramuscular depot injections (such as with Estradiol Cypionate) through improved lipophilicity [T84]. Following absorption, the esters are cleaved, resulting in the release of endogenous estradiol, or 17ß-estradiol. 

Recommendations for treatment of menopausal symptoms changed drastically following the release of results and early termination of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies in 2002 as a number of concerns were raised regarding the use of estrogen [A31626]. Specifically, the combined estrogen–progestin arm was discontinued after approximately five years of follow up due to a statistically significant increase in invasive breast cancer and in cardiovascular events [A31627]. Following extensive critique of the WHI results in the years following its release, Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is now recommended to be used only for a short period (for 3-5 years post-menopause) in low doses, and in women without a history of breast cancer or at increased risk of cardiovascular or thromboembolic disease [A31628]. Notably, use of estrogen for menopausal symptoms should always be accompanied by a progestin component due to estrogen's effects on the endometrium; in women with an intact uterus, unopposed estrogen has been shown to promote the growth of the endometrium which can lead to endometrial hyperplasia and possibly cancer in the long-term. 

[DB00977] (EE) is a synthetic form of estradiol commonly used as the estrogenic component of most combination Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCPs). Ethinyl Estradiol differs from Estradiol in that it has improved biovailability and greater resistance to metabolism, making it more suitable for oral administration.","50-28-2","4TI98Z838E",272.382,272.177630012,"solid",3,13,1,0,"Akira Nakagawa, Munehiko Hirano, Miyuki Shinmura, ""Estradiol percutaneous administration preparations.""

When the estrogen receptor has bound its ligand it can enter the nucleus of the target cell, and regulate gene transcription which leads to formation of messenger RNA. The mRNA interacts with ribosomes to produce specific proteins that express the effect of estradiol upon the target cell.

MR images are based primarily on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. MR instruments are sensitive to two different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). Paramagnetic agents contain one or more unpaired electrons that enhance the T1 and T2 relaxation rates of protons in their molecular environment. The proton relaxation effect (PRE) of an unpaired electron is 700 times stronger than that of a proton itself. In MRI, visualization of normal and pathological brain tissue depends in part on variations in the radio frequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in T2. When placed in a magnetic field, gadopentetate dimeglumine shortens the T1 and T2 relaxation times in tissues where it accumulates. In the central nervous system (CNS), gadopentetate dimeglumine enhances visualization of normal tissues that lack a blood-brain barrier, such as the pituitary gland and the meninges. Gadopentetate dimeglumine does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier; therefore, it does not accumulate in normal brain tissue or in CNS lesions that have not caused an abnormal blood-brain barrier (e.g., cysts, mature post-operative scars). Abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadopentetate dimeglumine in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and subacute infarcts.

Perindoprilat lowers blood pressure by antagonizing the effect of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain the effects of perindoprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.","There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Perindoprilat, the active metabolite of perindopril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Perindopril also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors.","Extensively metabolized, with only 4-12% of the dose recovered in urine following oral administration.

It is administered orally as the prodrug, candesartan cilexetil, which is rapidly converted to its active metabolite, candesartan, during absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan lowers blood pressure by antagonizing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); it competes with angiotensin II for binding to the type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) subtype and prevents the blood pressure increasing effects of angiotensin II. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, ARBs do not have the adverse effect of dry cough. Candesartan may be used to treat hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and diabetic nephropathy. It may also be used as an alternative agent for the treatment of heart failure, systolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease.","145040-37-5","R85M2X0D68",610.671,610.253982839,"solid",1,3,2,0,"Marina Etinger, Boris Fedotev, Ben-Zion Dolitzky, ""Preparation of candesartan cilexetil.""

Candesartan may be also used as a second line agent in the treatment of congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease in those intolerant of ACE inhibitors.","Candesartan cilexetil is an ARB prodrug that is rapidly converted to candesartan, its active metabolite, during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan confers blood pressure lowering effects by antagonizing the hypertensive effects of angiotensin II via the RAAS. RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. Renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by increasing total peripheral resistance, increasing sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys via aldosterone secretion, and altering cardiovascular structure. Angiotensin II binds to two receptors: type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) and type-2 angiotensin II receptor (AT2). AT1 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that mediates the vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. Studies performed in recent years suggest that AT2 antagonizes AT1-mediated effects and directly affects long-term blood pressure control by inducing vasorelaxation and increasing urinary sodium excretion. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are non-peptide competitive inhibitors of AT1. ARBs block the ability of angiotensin II to stimulate pressor and cell proliferative effects. Unlike ACE inhibitors, ARBs do not affect bradykinin-induced vasodilation. The overall effect of ARBs is a decrease in blood pressure.","Candesartan selectively blocks the binding of angiotensin II to AT1 in many tissues including vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal glands. This inhibits the AT1-mediated vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II and results in an overall decrease in blood pressure. Candesartan is greater than 10,000 times more selective for AT1 than AT2. Inhibition of aldosterone secretion may increase sodium and water excretion while decreasing potassium excretion.","The prodrug candesartan cilexetil undergoes rapid and complete ester hydrolysis in the intestinal wall to form the active drug, candesartan. Elimination of candesartan is primarily as unchanged drug in the urine and, by the biliary route, in the feces. Minor hepatic metabolism of candesartan (<20%) occurs by O-deethylation via cytochrome P450 2C9 to form an inactive metabolite. Candesartan undergoes N-glucuronidation in the tetrazole ring by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A3 (UGT1A3). O-glucuronidation may also occur. 75% of candesartan is excreted as unchanged drug in urine and feces.","Following administration of the candesartan cilexetil prodrug, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%. Food with a high fat content has no effect on the bioavailability of candesartan from candesartan cilexetil.","Approximately 9 hours.","Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells.","When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine.

It is primarily indicated for use in treating hepatitis C and viral hemorrhagic fevers. HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. It is reported that ribavirin might be only effective in early stages of viral hemorrhagic fevers including Lasser fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infection. Ribavirin is a prodrug that is metabolized into nucleoside analogs that blocks viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping. Before the development of newer drugs, ribavirin and [DB00008]/[DB00022] dual therapy was considered the first-generation and standard antiviral treatment [A19626]. The dual therapy was administered for 48 weeks in patients with genotype 1, 4, 5, and 6, and 24 weeks in patients with genotype 2 and 3 [A19626]. Newer drugs developed as Hepatitis C viral infection treatments can be used to reduce or eliminate the use of ribavirin, which are associated with serious adverse effects. They also improve therapeutic efficacy in patients with failed [DB00008]/[DB00022] and ribavirin-based therapy. The potential use of ribavirin as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia is currently under investigation.

According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), ribavirin is typically used as an adjunct therapy to various first-line and second-line combination therapies recommended for each genotypes. Ribavirin is added to decrease relapse rates by accelerating viral clearance early in the treatment course [A19645]. When used to treat Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, it is always used as a part of combination therapies as ribavirin monotherapy is not efficacious in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection [A19644]. Additionally, including ribavirin in the regimen can increase the risk of anemia. 

In HCV genotye 1/2/3/4/5/6 patients, ribavirin can be used in combination therapy involving [DB09102] and [DB08934], Eplusa ([DB08934], [DB11613]), Harvoni ([DB08934], [DB09027]), [DB06290] and [DB08934], Viekira Pak ([DB09296], [DB09297], [DB00503], [DB09183]), Technivie ([DB00503], [DB09296], [DB09297]) and Zepatier ([DB11574], [DB11575]). Addition of weight-based ribavirin to Technivie therapy increased sustained virologic response after 12 weeks of daily therapy (SVR12) from 90% to 97% in patients with HCV genotype 1a and 90.9% to 100% in HCV genotype 4 patients [L852]. Zepatier therapy along with ribavirin improved SVR in HCV genotype 5 patients. Combination therapy of ribavirin and [DB00008] results in the SVR of 44% in patients with genotype 1 infection and 70% in patients with genotype 2-6. The inclusion of ribavirin in the combination therapies depend on individual patient's profile, for example if HCV genotype 3 patient has a Y93H genetic variant and compensated cirrhosis.","36791-04-5","49717AWG6K",244.2047,244.080769514,"solid",1,8,0,2,NA,"Indicated for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in combination with other antiviral agents with the intent to cure or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR). Typically added to improve SVR and reduce relapse rates [A19644].

The addition of ribavirin in Technivie therapy indicated for treating HCV genotype 1a and 4 infections is recommended in patients with or without cirrhosis. 

Resistance: viral genetic determinants resulting in variable response to ribavirin therapy has not been yet determined.","Ribavirin mediates direct antiviral activity against a number of DNA and RNA viruses by increasing the mutation frequency in the genomes of several RNA viruses. It is a member of the nucleoside antimetabolite drugs that interfere with duplication of the viral genetic material. The drug inhibits the activity of the enzyme RNA dependent RNA polymerase, due to its resemblence to building blocks of the RNA molecules.","Ribavirin is reported to have several mechanism of actions that lead to inhibition of viral RNA and protein synthesis. 
After activation by adenosine kinase to ribavirin mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites. Ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) is the predominant metabolite which directly inhibits viral mRNA polymerase by binding to the nucleotide binding site of the enzyme. This prevents the binding of the correct nucleotides, leading to a reduction in viral replication or to the production of defective virions [A19645]. RTP also demonstrates an inhibitory action on viral mRNA guanylyltransferase and mRNA 2'-O-methyltransferase of dengue virus. Inhibition of these enzymes disrupts the posttranslational capping of the 5' end of viral mRNA through ribavirin being incorporated at the 5' end in place of guanosine and preventing the cap methylation step. 

Inhibition of host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and subsequent depletion of GTP pool is proposed to be another mechanism of action of ribavirin. IMPDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step where inosine 5'-monophosphate is converted to xanthine monophosphate during guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthesis. GMP is later converted to guanosine triphoshpate (GTP). Ribavirin monophosphate mimics inosine 5'-monophosphate and acts as a competitive inhibitor of IMPDH. Inhibited de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides and decreased intracellular GTP pools leads to a decline in viral protein synthesis and limit replication of viral genomes [A19645].

Ribavirin acts as a mutagen in the target virus to cause an 'error catastrophe' due to increased viral mutations. RTP pairs with cytidine triphosphate or uridine triphosphate with equal efficiency and to block HCV RNA elongation. It causes premature termination of nascent HCV RNA and increases mutagenesis by producing defective virions [A19645].

Ribavirin also exerts an immunomodulatory action of the host to the virus by shifting a Th2 response in favor of a Th1 phenotype. Th2 response and production of type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 stimulates the humoral response which enhances immunity toward the virus [A19645]. Ribavirin enhanced induction of interferon-related genes, including the interferon-a receptor, and down-regulation of genes involved in interferon inhibition, apoptosis, and hepatic stellate cell activation in vitro [A19644].","First and as a step required for activation, ribavirin is phosphorylated intracellularly by adenosine kinase to ribavirin mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites. After activation and function, ribavirin undergoes two metabolic pathways where it is reversibly phosphorlyated or degraded via deribosylation and amide hydrolysis to yield a triazole carboxylic acid metabolite. In vitro studies indicate that ribavirin is not a substrate of CYP450 enzymes [L864].","Ribavirin is reported to be rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration. The average time to reach Cmax was 2 hours after oral administration of 1200 mg ribavirin [FDA Label]. The oral bioavailability is 64% following a single oral dose administration of 600mg ribavirin [L864].","The terminal half-life of ribavirin following administration of a single oral dose of 1200 mg is about 120 to 170 hours [FDA Label].","No protein binding reported [L864].","The metabolites of ribavirin are renally excreted.

Ribavirin-induced anemia is a dose-dependent adverse effect where reduced hemoglobin levels can be seen within the first 1-2 weeks in therapy. The mechanism of ribavirin-induced anemia has been shown to involve reductions in reticulocyte counts and erythrocyte Na-K pump activity, and increases in K-Cl cotransport, membrane bound IgG, and C3, and erythrocyte band 3 [A19644].

Part of the physiological process of erection involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum. This then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), leading to smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in increased inflow of blood and an erection. Tadalafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This means that, with tadalafil on board, normal sexual stimulation leads to increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum which leads to better erections. Without sexual stimulation and no activation of the NO/cGMP system, tadalafil should not cause an erection.","Penile erection during sexual stimulation is achieved by the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscles, leading to increased blood flow to the organ. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, and is degraded by the cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis. Tadalafil inhibits PDE5 and thereby enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP available.","Tadalafil is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 to a catechol metabolite.

Given diazepam's storied history as a commonly used and effective medication for a variety of indications, contemporary advancements in the formulation and administration of the agent include the development and US FDA approval of an auto-injectable formulation for the rapid treatment of uncontrolled seizures in 2015-2016 [L5200]. Combining diazepam, a proven effective therapy for acute repetitive seizures, with an auto-injector designed for subcutaneous administration that is quickly and easily administered offers the potential for complete, consistent drug absorption and rapid onset of effect [L5200].

Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.","In general, diazepam is useful in the symptomatic management of mild to moderate degrees of anxiety in conditions dominated by tension, excitation, agitation, fear, or aggressiveness such as may occur in psychoneurosis, anxiety reactions due to stress conditions, and anxiety states with somatic expression [F3160].

Moreover, in acute alcoholic withdrawal, diazepam may be useful in the symptomatic relief of acute agitation, tremor, and impending acute delirium tremens [F3160].

Furthermore, diazepam is a useful adjunct for the relief of skeletal muscle spasm due to reflex spasm to local pathologies, such as inflammation of the muscle and joints or secondary to trauma; spasticity caused by upper motor neuron disorders, such as cerebral palsy and paraplegia; athetosis and the rare ""stiff man syndrome"" [F3160].

Particular label information from the United Kingdom also lists particular age-specific indications, including for adults: (1) The short-term relief (2-4 weeks) only, of anxiety which is severe, disabling, or subjecting the individual to unacceptable distress, occurring alone or in association with insomnia or short-term psychosomatic, organic or psychotic illness, (2) cerebral palsy, (3) muscle spasm, (4) as an adjunct to certain types of epilepsy (eg. myoclonus), (5) symptomatic treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal, (6) as oral premedication for the nervous dental patient, and (7) for premedication before surgery [L5188].

In the same UK label information, diazepam is indicated in children for: (1) control of tension and irritability in cerebral spasticity in selected cases, (2) as an adjunct to the control of muscle spasm in tetanus, and for (3) oral premedication [L5188].","Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that exerts anxiolytic, sedative, muscle- relaxant, anticonvulsant and amnestic effects [F3157, F3160, L5188]. Most of these effects are thought to result from facilitation of the action of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system [F3157, F3160, L5188].","Diazepam is a benzodiazepine tranquilliser with anticonvulsant, sedative, muscle relaxant and amnesic properties [F3157, F3160, L5188].

Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, bind to receptors in various regions of the brain and spinal cord. This binding increases the inhibitory effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [F3157, F3160, L5188]. GABAs functions include CNS involvement in sleep induction. Also involved in the control of hypnosis, memory, anxiety, epilepsy and neuronal excitability [F3157, F3160, L5188].","Diazepam is N-demethylated by CYP3A4 and 2C19 to the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam, and is hydroxylated by CYP3A4 to the active metabolite temazepam [F3157, F3160]. N-desmethyldiazepam and temazepam are both further metabolized to oxazepam [F3157, F3160]. Temazepam and oxazepam are further largely eliminated by way of conjugation to glucuronic acid via glucuronidation [F3157, F3160].

Furthermore, oxidation of diazepam is mediated by cytochrome P450 isozymes; formation of desmethyl-diazepam mainly by CYP2C19 and CYP3A and 3-hydroxy-diazepam (temazepam) and oxazepam by CYP3A. Because CYP2C19 is polymorphic, extensive metabolizers (EMs), and poor metabolizers (PMs) of diazepam can be distinguished [F3157, F3160]. PMs of diazepam showed significantly lower clearance (12 vs 26 mL/min) and longer elimination half-life (88 vs 41 h) of diazepam than EMs after a single oral dose [F3157, F3160]. Also, PMs had lower clearance, higher AUC and longer elimination half-life of desmethyl-diazepam [F3157, F3160].","After oral administration, it is considered that diazepam is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract as  >90% of diazepam is absorbed and the average time to achieve peak plasma concentrations is 1 – 1.5 hours with a range of 0.25 to 2.5 hours [F3157, F3160, L5188].

Absorption is delayed and decreased when administered with a moderate fat meal [F3157]. In the presence of food mean lag times are approximately 45 minutes as compared with 15 minutes when fasting [F3157]. There is also an increase in the average time to achieve peak concentrations to about 2.5 hours in the presence of food as compared with 1.25 hours when fasting [F3157]. This results in an average decrease in Cmax of 20% in addition to a 27% decrease in AUC (range 15% to 50%) when administered with food [F3157].","Diazepam has a biphasic half-life with an initial rapid distribution phase followed by a prolonged terminal elimination phase of 1 or 2 days; its action is further prolonged by the even longer half-life of 2-5 days of its principal active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam (nordiazepam), the relative proportion of which increases in the body on long-term administration [L5188]. The plasma half-life of diazepam is prolonged in neonates, in the elderly, and in patients with kidney or liver disease [L5188].","Despite high binding to plasma proteins (98-99%) - mainly albumin and to a lesser extent a1-acid glycoprotein - diazepam is widely distributed into tissues and crosses the blood-brain barrier and is highly lipid soluble, which causes the initial effects to decrease rapidly as it is redistributed into fat deposits and tissues [F3157, F3160, L5188].","Diazepam and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine, predominantly as their glucuronide conjugates [F3157, F3160, L5188].","In young healthy males, the volume of distribution at steady-state is 0.8 to 1.0 L/kg [F3157].","The clearance of diazepam is 20 to 30 mL/min in young adults [F3157, F3160].","DiapamOrionNerviumSabaRelaniumGlaxoSmithKline",2,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00829.pdf?1265922800","//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00829.pdf?1265922740",4,1907,"The symptoms of diazepam overdose are mainly an intensification of the therapeutic effects (ataxia, drowsiness, dysarthria, sedation, muscle weakness, profound sleep, hypotension, bradycardia, nystagmus) or paradoxical excitation [F3157, F3160, L5188]. In most cases only observation of vital functions is required [F3157, F3160, L5188].

Extreme overdosage may lead to coma, areflexia, cardio-respiratory depression and apnoea, requiring appropriate countermeasures (ventilation, cardiovascular support) [F3157, F3160, L5188].

Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with severe chronic obstructive airways disease [F3157, F3160, L5188]. Severe effects in overdose also include rhabdomyolysis and hypothermia [L5188]. Overdose of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol) may be fatal and should be closely monitored [F3157].

In general, the use of diazepam in women of childbearing potential, and more specifically during known pregnancy, should be considered only when the clinical situation warrants the risk to the fetus [F3157]. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered [F3157]. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [F3157]. Patients should also be advised that if they become pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physician about the desirability of discontinuing the drug [F3157].

Special care must be taken when diazepam is used during labor and delivery, as high single doses may produce irregularities in the fetal heart rate and hypotonia, poor sucking, hypothermia, and moderate respiratory depression in the neonates [F3157]. With newborn infants it must be remembered that the enzyme system involved in the breakdown of the drug is not yet fully developed (especially in premature infants) [F3157].

Diazepam passes into breast milk [F3157]. Breastfeeding is therefore not recommended in patients receiving diazepam [F3157].

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established [F3157].

In elderly patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia or oversedation (2 mg to 2.5 mg once or twice daily, initially to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated) [F3157]. Extensive accumulation of diazepam and its major metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, has been noted following chronic administration of diazepam in healthy elderly male subjects. Metabolites of this drug are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function [F3157]. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [F3157].

Decreases in clearance and protein binding, and increases in volume of distribution and half-life has been reported in patients with cirrhosis [F3157]. In such patients, a 2- to 5- fold increase in mean half-life has been reported [F3157]. Delayed elimination has also been reported for the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam [F3157]. Benzodiazepines are commonly implicated in hepatic encephalopathy [F3157]. Increases in half-life have also been reported in hepatic fibrosis and in both acute and chronic hepatitis [F3157]."

It is normally applied to a plastic tape called Cordran.  Cordran is primarily effective because of its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions. Flurandrenolide, which is slowly released from the Cordran tape, binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. Cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In another words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.  Like other glucocorticoid agents Fluocinolone acetonide acts as a physiological antagonist to insulin by decreasing glycogenesis (formation of glycogen).  It also promotes the breakdown of lipids (lipolysis), and proteins, leading to the mobilization of extrahepatic amino acids and ketone bodies. This leads to increased circulating glucose concentrations (in the blood). There is also decreased glycogen formation in the liver.

Cells lines that have lower levels of AGT are more sensitive to the cytotoxicity of temozolomide.

It is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Penile erection is a hemodynamic process initiated by the relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum and its associated arterioles. During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase resulting in increased synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. The cGMP in turn triggers smooth muscle relaxation, allowing increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in erection. The tissue concentration of cGMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is the cGMPspecific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5); therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP.","224785-90-4","UCE6F4125H",488.603,488.220574232,"solid",1,0,0,0,"Yogesh S.

Vardenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This means that, with vardenafil on board, normal sexual stimulation leads to increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum which leads to better erections. Without sexual stimulation and no activation of the NO/cGMP system, vardenafil should not cause an erection.","Vardenafil inhibits the cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis. Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) by vardenafil enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP.","Vardenafil is metabolized predominantly by the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4, with contribution from the CYP3A5 and CYP2C isoforms.

Moreover, LE was purposefully engineered to be a 'soft drug', one that is designed to be active locally at the site of administration and then rapidly metabolized to inactive components after eliciting its actions at the desired location, thereby subsequently minimizing the chance for adverse effects [A38693].","82034-46-6","YEH1EZ96K6",466.96,466.175831,"solid",1,4,0,2,NA,"A number of prescription loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic products are specifically indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery [FDA Label].","Loteprednol etabonate (LE) belongs to a unique class of corticosteroids with potent anti-inflammatory effects designed to be active at the site of action [A1312, L4539]. Animal studies have shown that LE has a binding affinity to steroid receptors that is 4.3 times greater than dexamethasone [L4539]. This particular class of steroids consists of bioactive molecules whose in-vivo transformation to non-toxic substances can be predicted from their chemistry and knowledge of enzymatic pathways in the body [L4539]. Cortienic acid is an inactive metabolite of hydrocortisone and analogs of cortienic acid are also devoid of corticosteroid activity [L4539]. Specifically, LE is an ester derivative of one of these analogs, cortienic acid etabonate [L4539]. In particular, LE possesses a metabolically labile 17 beta-chloromethyl ester function which was designed in order to be hydrolyzed to an inactive carboxylic acid moiety [A1312]. This inactive metabolite is more hydrophilic and is thus readily eliminated from the body [A1312]. LE also exhibits good ocular permeation properties and good skin permeation properties [A1312].","Corticosteroids like loteprednol etabonate inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and likely delay or slow healing [FDA Label, L4539, A1312]. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation that are commonly associated with inflammation [FDA Label, A1312]. While glucocorticoids are known to bind to and activate the glucocorticoid receptor, the molecular mechanisms involved in glucocorticoid/glucocorticoid receptor-dependent modulation of inflammation are not clearly established [FDA Label, L4539, A1312]. Moreover, corticosteroids are thought to inhibit prostaglandin production through several independent mechanisms [FDA Label, A1312]. In particular, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins [F1467]. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid [F1467]. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 [F1467].  

The use of LE subsequently treats post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery by managing the prostaglandin release, recruitment and travel of neutrophils and macrophages, and production of other inflammatory mediators that are intrinsically associated with the physical trauma of surgery [A1312].","Loteprednol etabonate (LE) is readily and extensively metabolized to two inactive metabolites, PJ-90 (<U+0394>1-cortienic acid) and PJ-91 (<U+0394>1-cortienic acid etabonate) [FDA Label, F1467].  Metabolism occurs locally in ocular tissues, and to the extent that loteprednol etabonate reaches the systemic circulation, likely the liver and other tissues into which it distributes [F1467].

In particular, studies have demonstrated that LE (chloromethyl 17alpha-ethoxycarbonyloxy-11beta-hydroxy-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-diene) is rapidly hydrolyzed at the location of its 17beta-chloromethyl ester function by paraoxonase 1 in human plasma at the site of administration at the level of the affected eye tissue to the 17beta-carboxylate PJ-91 metabolite and PJ-90 metabolite [A38681, A38693]. Both metabolites are considered inactive [FDA Label, A38693, A38693].","Loteprednol etabonate (LE) demonstrates good ocular permeation properties as it is lipid soluble, allowing the agent to penetrate into cells with relative ease [FDA Label, A1312].

Results from the ocular administration of loteprednol in normal, healthy volunteers have shown that there are low or undetectable concentrations of either unchanged material or its metabolite [L4539]. Following twice-daily unilateral topical ocular dosing of LE for 14 days in healthy subjects, the plasma concentrations of loteprednol etabonate were below the limit of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all time points [FDA Label].

"DB00874","APRD01005","small molecule",2005-06-13,2019-07-02,"Guaifenesin","Guaifenesin possesses a storied history, having been originally formally approved by the US FDA in 1952 and continues to be one of very few - if not perhaps the only drug that is readily available and used as an expectorant [F4525]. Since that time the agent has been a combination component of various prescription and non-prescription over-the-counter cough and cold products and is currently a widely available over-the-counter generic medication [F4525]. Although it is principally believed that guaifenesin elicits an action to facilitate productive cough to manage chest congestion [A177661, L6100, F4516, F4522, F4525], it is not known whether the agent can reliably mitigate coughing.

Regardless, on March 1, 2007, the FDA received a petition asking the FDA to notify the public that some antitussives, expectorants, decongestants, antihistamines, and cough/cold combinations are not known to be safe and effective in children under the age of 6 years [F4525]. After the negotiation between FDA and major manufacturers, a voluntary transition of labels for not using guaifenesin in children under the age of 4 years was endorsed by FDA in 2008 [F4525].

Furthermore, there has also been contemporary research to suggest that guaifenesin possesses and is capable of demonstrating anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant effects to some degree possibly by acting as an NMDA receptor antagonist [A177652].","93-14-1","495W7451VQ",198.2158,198.089208936,"solid",3,5,0,2,"Wilfred P. Shum, Harry Mazurek, Jian Chen, ""Process for producing enantiomerically enriched guaifenesin.""

Furthermore, guaifenesin elicits an increased flow of less viscous gastric secretions that subsequently promote ciliary action - all actions that ultimately change dry, unproductive coughing to coughs that are more productive and less frequent [F4516]. Essentially, by decreasing the viscosity and adhesiveness of such secretions, guaifenesin enhances the efficacy of mucociliary activity in removing accumulated secretions from the upper and lower airway [F4516].","Although the exact mechanism of action of guaifenesin may not yet be formally or totally elucidated, it is believed that expectorants like guaifenesin function by increasing mucus secretion [A177661]. Moreover, it is also further proposed that such expectorants may also act as an irritant to gastric vagal receptors, and recruit efferent parasympathetic reflexes that can elicit glandular exocytosis that is comprised of a less viscous mucus mixture [A177661]. Subsequently, these actions may provoke coughing that can ultimately flush difficult to access, congealed mucopurulent material from obstructed small airways to facilitate a temporary improvement for the individual [A177661].

Consequently, while it is generally proposed that guaifenesin functions as an expectorant by helping to loosen phlegm (mucus) and thin bronchial secretions to rid the bronchial passageways of bothersome mucus and make coughs more productive, there has also been research to suggest that guaifenesin possesses and is capable of demonstrating anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant effects to some degree possibly by acting as an NMDA receptor antagonist [A177652].","After the oral administration of 400 mg guaifenesin, the agent experiences rapid hydrolysis (more than 60% of the dose hydrolyzed over a range of seven hours) with ß-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-lactic acid found as the major urinary metabolite but no parent drug detectable in the urine [A177676, L6100]. Moreover, it has been observed that guaifenesin also experiences both oxidation and demethylation [A177676]. In particular, the medication is quickly metabolized hepatically by way of oxidation to ß-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-lactic acid [A177676]. Furthermore, guaifenesin is also demethylated by O-demethylase in liver microsomes to the point where about 40% of an administered dose is excreted as this metabolite in the urine within 3 hours [A177676]. In fact, O-demethylase appears to be the primary enzyme for the metabolism of guaifenesin and the primary metabolites of the substance are ß-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-lactic acid and the demethylated hydroxyguaifenesin, both of which are themselves inactive moieties [A177676].","Studies have shown that guaifenesin is well absorbed from and along the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration [A177634, F4522, L6100].","The half-life in plasma observed for guaifenesin is approximately one hour [A177676, L6079, L6100, F4522, F4525].","Information regarding the protein binding of guaifenesin is not readily available or accessible.","After administration, guaifenesin is metabolized and then largely excreted in the urine [A177676, L6079, L6100, F4522, F4525].","The geometric mean apparent volume of distribution of guaifenesin determined in healthy adult subjects is 116L (CV=45.7%) [F4525].","The mean clearance recorded for guaifenesin is about 94.8 L/hr (CV=51.4%) [F4525].","Duratuss GGanidinCypressHustosilKyoto YakuhinHytussHyrexRobitussinWyethScot-tussin ExpectorantSinumist-SR",0,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00874.pdf?1265922795","//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00874.pdf?1265922735",2,0,"The most prevalent signs and symptoms associated with an overdose of guaifenesin have been nausea and vomiting [L6100].

Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue. Chlorothiazide affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. At maximal therapeutic dosages, all thiazides are approximately equal in their diuretic efficacy.

May also be used to slow the rate of progression of renal disease in hypertensive individuals with diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria or overt nephropathy.","Quinapril is a nonpeptide, non-sulfhydryl prodrug that is deesterified to quinaprilat (quinapril diacid), its major active metabolite following oral administration. Quinaprilat lowers blood pressure by antagonizing the effect of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain the effects of quinaprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.","There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Quinaprilat, the principle active metabolite of quinapril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Quinaprilat also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors.","Hepatic.","Peak plasma concentrations of quinapril occur within one hour following oral administration.

Merrell Company.","Used mainly in female infertility due to anovulation (e.g. due to polycystic ovary syndrome) to induce ovulation.","Clomifene (previously clomiphene) is an orally administered, non steroidal, ovulatory stimulant that acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Clomifene can lead to multiple ovulation, and hence increase the risk of conceiving twins. In comparison to purified FSH, the rate of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is low. There may be an increased risk of ovarian cancer and weight gain. Clomifene is capable of interacting with estrogen-receptor-containing tissues, including the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary, endometrium, vagina, and cervix. It may compete with estrogen for estrogen-receptor-binding sites and may delay replenishment of intracellular estrogen receptors. Clomifene initiates a series of endocrine events culminating in a preovulatory gonadotropin surge and subsequent follicular rupture. The first endocrine event, in response to a course of clomifene therapy, is an increase in the release of pituitary gonadotropins. This initiates steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis resulting in growth of the ovarian follicle and an increase in the circulating level of estradiol. Following ovulation, plasma progesterone and estradiol rise and fall as they would in a normal ovulatory cycle.","Clomifene has both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic properties, but its precise mechanism of action has not been determined. Clomifene appears to stumulate the release of gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and leuteinizing hormone (LH), which leads to the development and maturation of ovarian follicle, ovulation, and subsequent development and function of the coprus luteum, thus resulting in pregnancy. Gonadotropin release may result from direct stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis or from a decreased inhibitory influence of estrogens on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis by competing with the endogenous estrogens of the uterus, pituitary, or hypothalamus. Clomifene has no apparent progestational, androgenic, or antrandrogenic effects and does not appear to interfere with pituitary-adrenal or pituitary-thyroid function.","Hepatic","Based on early studies with 14 C-labeled clomifene, the drug was shown to be readily absorbed orally in humans.","5-7 days",NA,"Based on early studies with 14C-labeled clomiphene citrate, the drug was shown to be readily absorbed orally in humans and excreted principally in the feces.

i) efficacy and tolerance of ondansetron were similar to that observed in younger adults for the treatment of post-chemotherapy and radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and
ii) clinical experience in the use of ondansetron in the prevention and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting is limited and is not indicated for use in the geriatric patient population","Ondansetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, not shown to have activity at other known serotonin receptors and with low affinity for dopamine receptors [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The temporal relationship between the emetogenic action of emetogenic drugs and the release of serotonin, as well as the efficacy of antiemetic agents, suggest that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161].

Moreover, the effect of ondansetron on the QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controlled, crossover study in 58 healthy adult men and women [F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron was tested at single doses of 8 mg and 32 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. At the highest tested dose of 32 mg, prolongation of the Fridericia-corrected QTc interval (QT/RR0.33=QTcF) was observed from 15 min to 4 h after the start of the 15 min infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 19.6 (21.5) msec at 20 min [F3181, F3184]. At the lower tested dose of 8 mg, QTc prolongation was observed from 15 min to 1 h after the start of the 15-minute infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 5.8 (7.8) msec at 15 min [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation with ondansetron is expected to be greater if the infusion rate is faster than 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. The 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron must not be administered [F3181, F3184]. No treatment-related effects on the QRS duration or the PR interval were observed at either the 8 or 32 mg dose [F3181, F3184].

An ECG assessment study has not been performed for orally administered ondansetron [F3181, F3184]. On the basis of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling, an 8 mg oral dose of ondansetron is predicted to cause a mean QTcF increase of 0.7 ms (90% CI -2.1, 3.3) at steady-state, assuming a mean maximal plasma concentration of 24.7 ng/mL (95% CI 21.1, 29.0) [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation at the recommended 5 mg/m2 dose in pediatrics has not been studied, but pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling predicts a mean increase of 6.6 ms (90% CI 2.8, 10.7) at maximal plasma concentrations [F3181, F3184]. 

In healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time [F3178]. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in healthy subjects [F3178]. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations [F3178].","Ondansetron is a selective antagonist of the serotonin receptor subtype, 5-HT3 [F3178, F3181, F3184].

Cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated with the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, presumably initiating a vomiting reflex through stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron may block the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a central release of serotonin from the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Thus, the antiemetic effect of ondansetron is probably due to the selective antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors on neurons located in either the peripheral or central nervous systems, or both [F3178, F3181, F3184].

Although the mechanisms of action of ondansetron in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting and cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting may share similar pathways, the role of ondansetron in opiate-induced emesis has not yet been formally established [F3181, F3184].","In vitro metabolism studies have shown that ondansetron is a substrate for human hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 [F3178, F3181, F3184]. In terms of overall ondansetron turnover, CYP3A4 played the predominant role [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Because of the multiplicity of metabolic enzymes capable of metabolizing ondansetron, it is likely that inhibition or loss of one enzyme (e.g. CYP2D6 enzyme deficiency) will be compensated by others and may result in little change in overall rates of ondansetron clearance [F3178, F3181, F3184].

Following oral or IV administration, ondansetron is extensively metabolised and excreted in the urine and faeces [F3178, F3181, F3184]. In humans, less than 10% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine [F3178, F3181, F3184]. The major urinary metabolites are glucuronide conjugates (45%), sulphate conjugates (20%) and hydroxylation products (10%) [F3178, F3181, F3184]. The primary metabolic pathway is subsequently hydroxylation on the indole ring followed by subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Although some nonconjugated metabolites have pharmacologic activity, these are not found in plasma at concentrations likely to significantly contribute to the biological activity of ondansetron [F3178, F3181, F3184].","Ondansetron is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and undergoes some limited first-pass metabolism [F3178]. Mean bioavailability in healthy subjects, following administration of a single 8-mg tablet, was recorded as being approximately 56% to 60% [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Bioavailability is also slightly enhanced by the presence of food [F3178].

Ondansetron systemic exposure does not increase proportionately to dose [F3178]. The AUC from a 16-mg tablet was 24% greater than predicted from an 8-mg tablet dose [F3178]. This may reflect some reduction of first-pass metabolism at higher oral doses [F3178].","The half-life of ondansetron after either an 8 mg oral dose or intravenous dose was approximately 3-4 hours and could be extended to 6-8 hours in the elderly [F3181, F3184].","The plasma protein binding associated with ondansetron was documented as approximately 73% [F3181, F3184].","Following oral or IV administration, ondansetron is extensively metabolised and excreted in the urine and faeces [F3181, F3184].","The volume of distribution of ondansetron has been recorded as being approximately 160L [A174250].","The clearance values determined for ondansetron in various patient age groups were recorded as approximately 0.38 L/h/kg in normal adult volunteers aged 19-40 yrs, 0.32 L/h/kg in normal adult volunteers aged 61-74 yrs, 0.26 L/h/kg in normal adult volunteers aged >=75 yrs [FDA Label].","Zophren",0,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00904.pdf?1265922799","//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00904.pdf?1265922739",1,1631,"At present, there is little information concerning overdosage with ondansetron [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Nevertheless, there have been certain cases of somewhat idiosyncratic adverse effects associated with particular dosages of ondansetron used [F3178, F3181, F3184].

“Sudden blindness” (amaurosis) of 2 to 3 minutes duration plus severe constipation occurred in one patient that was administered 72 mg of ondansetron intravenously as a single dose [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Hypotension (and faintness) occurred in another patient that took 48 mg of oral ondansetron [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Following infusion of 32 mg over only a 4-minute period, a vasovagal episode with transient second-degree heart block was observed [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Neuromuscular abnormalities, autonomic instability, somnolence, and a brief generalized tonic-clonic seizure (which resolved after a dose of benzodiazepine) were observed in a 12-month-old infant who ingested seven or eight 8-mg ondansetron tablets (approximately forty times the recommended 0.1-0.15 mg/kg dose for a pediatric patient) [F3178, F3181, F3184]. In all instances, however, the events resolved completely [F3178, F3181, F3184].

The safety of ondansetron for use in human pregnancy has not been established [F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron is not teratogenic in animals [F3181, F3184]. However, as animal studies are not always predictive of human response, the use of ondansetron in pregnancy is not recommended [F3181, F3184].

Ondansetron is excreted in the milk of lactating rats [F3181, F3184]. It is not known if it is excreted in human milk, however, nursing is not recommended during treatment with ondansetron [F3181, F3184].

Vitamin D requires two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH)2 D3], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis.1 Decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2 D3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2 D3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy.

It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to ß cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Repaglinide induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those naïve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Repaglinide is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile. Repaglinide metabolites do not possess appreciable hypoglycemic activity.

Membrane potential is regulated through an inverse relationship between the activity of cell membrane ATP-sensitive potassium channels (ABCC8) and extracellular glucose concentrations. Extracellular glucose enters the cell via GLUT2 (SLC2A2) transporters. Once inside the cell, glucose is metabolized to produce ATP. High concentrations of ATP inhibit ATP-sensitive potassium channels causing membrane depolarization. When extracellular glucose concentrations are low, ATP-sensitive potassium channels open causing membrane repolarization. High glucose concentrations cause ATP-sensitive potassium channels to close resulting in membrane depolarization and opening of L-type calcium channels. The influx of calcium ions stimulates calcium-dependent exocytosis of insulin granules. Repaglinide increases insulin release by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels in a glucose-dependent manner.","Repaglinide activity is dependent on the presence functioning &beta; cells and glucose. In contrast to sulfonylurea insulin secretatogogues, repaglinide has no effect on insulin release in the absence of glucose. Rather, it potentiates the effect of extracellular glucose on ATP-sensitive potassium channel and has little effect on insulin levels between meals and overnight. As such, repaglinide is more effective at reducing postprandial blood glucose levels than fasting blood glucose levels and requires a longer duration of therapy (approximately one month) before decreases in fasting blood glucose are observed. The insulinotropic effects of repaglinide are highest at intermediate glucose levels (3 to 10 mmol/L) and it does not increase insulin release already stimulated by high glucose concentrations (greater than 15 mmol/L). Repaglinide appears to be selective for pancreatic &beta; cells and does not appear to affect skeletal or cardiac muscle or thyroid tissue.","Repaglinide is rapidly metabolized via oxidation and dealkylation by cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2C9 to form the major dicarboxylic acid derivative (M2). Further oxidation produces the aromatic amine derivative (M1). Glucuronidation of the carboxylic acid group of repaglinide yields an acyl glucuronide (M7).

The lack of delta-agonist activity has been suggested to account for the observation that buprenorphine tolerance may not develop with chronic use.","52485-79-7","40D3SCR4GZ",467.6401,467.303558805,"solid",4,3,0,0,"Kazuhisa Ninomiya, Yasuhiro Fukushima, Mutsuo Okumura, Yuko Hosokawa, ""Buprenorphine percutaneous absorption preparation."" U.S. Patent US6090405, issued August, 1992.","For the treatment of moderate to severe pain, peri-operative analgesia, and opioid dependence.","Buprenorphine is a synthetic opioid analgesic and thebaine derivative, with a longer duration of action than morphine. Buprenorphine interacts predominately with the opioid mu-receptor. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues. In clinical settings, buprenorphine exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Buprenorphine may increase the patient's tolerance for pain and decrease the perception of suffering, although the presence of the pain itself may still be recognized. In addition to analgesia, alterations in mood, euphoria and dysphoria, and drowsiness commonly occur. Buprenorphine depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils. Pharmacological effects peaks at 15 minutes and persists for 6 hours or longer when given intramuscularly. When given intravenously, the time to onset and peak effect are shortened.","Buprenorphine's analgesic effect is due to partial agonist activity at mu-opioid receptors. Buprenorphine is also a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist. The partial agonist activity means that opioid receptor antagonists (e.g., an antidote such as naloxone) only partially reverse the effects of buprenorphine. The binding to the mu and kappa receptors results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability. Furthermore, buprenorphine slowly dissociates from its receptor. This observation would account for the longer duration of action compared to morphine, the unpredictability of its reversal by opioid antagonists, and its low level of manifest physical dependence. Its receptor fixation half life is 40 minutes which is significantly longer than morphine (milliseconds).","Hepatic. Buprenorphine undergoes both N-dealkylation to norbuprenorphine and glucuronidation. The N-dealkylation pathway is mediated by cytochrome P-450 3A4 isozyme. Norbuprenorphine, an active metabolite and has one-fifth of the pharmacologic activity of the parent compound, can further undergo glucuronidation.","31% bioavailability (sublingual). Sublingual absorption is also dependent on pH. The length of time the tablet is under the tongue has little effect on absorption. Although buprenorphine is rapidly absorbed from the oral mucosa, the absorption into the systemic is slower. The time to reach peak plasma concentration (Tmax) varies between individuals (range of 40 minutes to 3.5 hours). How buprenorphine is formulated does not affect this pharmacokinetic parameter. It also undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism and as a consequence, has very low oral bioavailability. Coadministration with naloxone does not effect the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine.","IV administration, 0.3 mg = 1.2 - 7.2 hours (mean 2.2 hours);

Interestingly, the results of various studies have demonstrated that long-term use of acetylsalicylic acid may decrease the risk of various cancers, including colorectal, esophageal, breast, lung, prostate, liver and skin cancer [A177325]. Aspirin is classified as a _non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor_ [A32682, A177268] and is available in many doses and forms, including chewable tablets, suppositories, extended release formulations, and others [L5968].

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), in the regular tablet form (immediate-release), is indicated to relieve pain, fever, and inflammation associated with many conditions, including the flu, the common cold, neck and back pain, dysmenorrhea, headache, tooth pain, sprains, fractures, myositis, neuralgia, synovitis, arthritis, bursitis, burns, and various injuries. It is also used for symptomatic pain relief after surgical and dental procedures [FDA label]. 

The _extra strength_ formulation of acetylsalicylic acid is also indicated for the management migraine pain with photophobia (sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound)[FDA label].

**Other indications**

ASA is also indicated for various other purposes, due to its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation. These include: 

Reducing the risk of cardiovascular death in suspected cases of myocardial infarction (MI) [FDA label]. 

Reducing the risk of a first non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients, and for reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality in cases of unstable angina and in those who have had a prior myocardial infarction [FDA label].

For reducing the risk of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and to prevent atherothrombotic cerebral infarction (in conjunction with other treatments) [FDA label].

**Important note regarding use of the extended-release formulation [F4405]**

In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, or before percutaneous interventions, the extended-release form of acetylsalicylic acid should not be used. Use immediate-release formulations in scenarios requiring rapid onset of action [Label, F4405]. The extended-release form is taken to decrease the incidence of mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) for individuals diagnosed with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD), including patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina or with chronic stable angina. Additionally, the extended-release form is used to decrease the risk of death and recurrent episodes of stroke in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [F4405].


","**Effects on pain and fever**

Acetylsalicylic acid disrupts the production of prostaglandins throughout the body by targeting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Prostaglandins are potent, irritating substances that have been shown to cause headaches and pain upon injection into humans.  Prostaglandins increase the sensitivity of pain receptors and substances such as histamine and bradykinin. Through the disruption of the production and prevention of release of prostaglandins in inflammation, this drug may stop their action at pain receptors, preventing symptoms of pain. Acetylsalicylic acid is considered an antipyretic agent because of its ability to interfere with the production of brain prostaglandin E1. Prostaglandin E1 is known to be an extremely powerful fever-inducing agent [FDA label]. 

**Effects on platelet aggregation**

The inhibition of platelet aggregation by ASA occurs because of its interference with thromboxane A2 in platelets, caused by COX-1 inhibition. Thromboxane A2 is an important lipid responsible for platelet aggregation, which can lead to clot formation and future risk of heart attack or stroke  [FDA label]. 

**A note on cancer prevention**

ASA has been studied in recent years to determine its effect on the prevention of various malignancies [A177325]. In general, acetylsalicylic acid is involved in the interference of various cancer signaling pathways, sometimes inducing or upregulating tumor suppressor genes [A177325, A177403]. Results of various studies suggest that there are beneficial effects of long-term ASA use in the prevention of several types of cancer, including stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, and liver cancers [A177400].   Research is ongoing.","Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) blocks prostaglandin synthesis. It is non-selective for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Inhibition of COX-1 results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation for about 7-10 days (average platelet lifespan). The acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid binds with a serine residue of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. This prevents the production of pain-causing prostaglandins. This process also stops the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation [FDA label].  Platelet aggregation can result in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism and stroke. 

It is important to note that there is 60% homology between the protein structures of COX-1 and COX-2. ASA binds to serine 516 residue on the active site of COX-2 in the same fashion as its binding to the serine 530 residue located on the active site of COX-1. The active site of COX-2 is, however, slightly larger than the active site of COX-1, so that arachidonic acid (which later becomes prostaglandins) manages to bypass the aspirin molecule inactivating COX-2 [A32682, A177256].  ASA, therefore, exerts more action on the COX-1 receptor rather than on the COX-2 receptor [A177268]. A higher dose of acetylsalicylic acid is required for COX-2 inhibition [A177325].","
Acetylsalicylic acid is hydrolyzed in the plasma to salicylic acid.  Plasma concentrations of aspirin following after administration of the extended-release form are mostly undetectable 4-8 hours after ingestion of a single dose. Salicylic acid was measured at 24 hours following a single dose of extended-release acetylsalicylic acid [F4405].

Salicylate is mainly metabolized in the liver, although other tissues may also be involved in this process [FDA label]. The major metabolites of acetylsalicylic acid are salicylic acid, salicyluric acid, the ether or phenolic glucuronide and the ester or acyl glucuronide. A small portion is converted to gentisic acid and other hydroxybenzoic acids [FDA label].

","
Absorption is generally rapid and complete following oral administration but absorption may be variable depending on the route, dosage form, and other factors including but not limited to the rate of tablet dissolution, gastric contents, gastric emptying time, and gastric pH [FDA label].

**Detailed absorption information**

When ingested orally, acetylsalicylic acid is rapidly absorbed in both the stomach and proximal small intestine. The non-ionized acetylsalicylic acid passes through the stomach lining by passive diffusion. Ideal absorption of salicylate in the stomach occurs in the pH range of 2.15 - 4.10. Intestinal absorption of acetylsalicylic acid occurs at a much faster rate.  At least half of the ingested dose is hydrolyzed to salicylic acid in the first-hour post-ingestion by esterases found in the gastrointestinal tract. Peak plasma salicylate concentrations occur between 1-2  hours post-administration [FDA label].","The half-life of ASA in the circulation ranges from 13 - 19 minutes. Blood concentrations drop rapidly after complete absorption. The half-life of the salicylate ranges between 3.5 and 4.5 hours  [FDA label].","50% to 90% of a normal therapeutic concentration salicylate (a main metabolite of acetylsalicylic acid [FDA label]) binds plasma proteins, particularly albumin, while acetylsalicylic acid itself binds negligibly [FDA label]. Acetylsalicylic acid has the ability to bind to and acetylate many proteins, hormones, DNA, platelets, and hemoglobin [FDA label].","Excretion of salicylates occurs mainly through the kidney, by the processes of glomerular filtration and tubular excretion, in the form of free salicylic acid, salicyluric acid, and, additionally, phenolic and acyl glucuronides [FDA label]. 

Salicylate can be found in the urine soon after administration, however, the entire dose takes about 48 hours to be completely eliminated. The rate of salicylate is often variable, ranging from 10% to 85% in the urine, and heavily depends on urinary pH.  Acidic urine generally aids in reabsorption of salicylate by the renal tubules, while alkaline urine increases excretion [FDA label].

After the administration of a typical 325mg dose, the elimination of ASA is found to follow first order kinetics in a linear fashion. At high concentrations, the elimination half-life increases [FDA label].","This drug is distributed to body tissues shortly after administration. It is known to cross the placenta. The plasma contains high levels of salicylate, as well as tissues such as spinal, peritoneal and synovial fluids, saliva and milk. The kidney, liver, heart, and lungs are also found to be rich in salicylate concentration after dosing. Low concentrations of salicylate are usually low, and minimal concentrations are found in feces, bile, and sweat [FDA label].","The clearance rate of acetylsalicylic acid is extremely variable, depending on several factors [A177217]. Dosage adjustments may be required in patients with renal impairment [FDA label]. The extended-release tablet should not be administered to patients with eGFR of less than 10 mL/min [F4405].","AcenterineAcetophenMerckAdiroAspergumAsproEasprinEmpirinNu-sealsRhodineRhonalSolprinSolprin acidSt. Joseph Aspirin for AdultsTasprin",7,"//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00945.pdf?1555434420","//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/msds/DB00945.pdf?1555532444",3,2143,"**Lethal doses**

**Acute toxicity**

Salicylate toxicity is a problem that may develop with both acute and chronic salicylate exposure [A35408]. 
Multiple organ systems may be affected by salicylate toxicity, including the central nervous system, the pulmonary system, and the gastrointestinal system. Severe bleeding may occur. In the majority of cases, patients suffering from salicylate toxicity are volume-depleted at the time of presentation for medical attention. Fluid resuscitation should occur immediately and volume status should be monitored closely.  Disruptions in acid-base balance are frequent in ASA toxicity [A35408]. 

The acute toxicity of acetylsalicylic in animals has been widely studied. The signs of poisoning in rats from lethal doses are mild to severe gastroenteritis, hepatitis, nephritis, pulmonary edema, encephalopathy, shock and some toxic effects on other organs and tissues. Mortality has been observed following convulsions or cardiovascular shock. An important differentiating property between various animal species is the ability to vomit toxic doses. Humans, cats and dogs have this ability, but rodents or rabbits do not [FDA label].  

**Chronic toxicity and carcinogenesis**

Chronic ASA toxicity is frequently accompanied by atypical clinical presentations that may be similar to diabetic ketoacidosis, delirium, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), myocardial infarction (MI) or cardiac failure. Plasma salicylate concentrations should be measured if salicylate intoxication is suspected, even if there no documentation available to suggest ASA was ingested. In older age, nephrotoxicity from salicylates increases, and the risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is increased, with higher rates of mortality [A32954]. It is also important to note that ASA toxicity may  occur even with close to normal serum concentrations. Prevention of chronic ASA includes the administration of smallest possible doses, avoidance of concurrent use of salicylate drugs, and therapeutic drug monitoring. Renal function should be regularly monitored and screening for gastrointestinal bleeding should be done at regular intervals [A32954]. 

Chronic toxicity studies were performed in rodents. ASA was administered at doses measured to be 2 to 20 times the maximum tolerated clinical dose to mice for up to one year. Negative dose-related effects were seen. These include decreased mean survival time, decreased number of births and progeny reaching an appropriate age for weaning. No evidence of carcinogenesis was found in 1-year studies [FDA label]. At daily doses of 0.24 g/kg/day given for 100 days to albino rats, ASA led to signs to excessive thirst, aciduria, diuresis, drowsiness, hyperreflexia, piloerection, changes in respiration, tachycardia, followed by soft stools, epistaxis, sialorrhea, dacryorrhea and mortality during hypothermic coma in the second study month [FDA label].

**Use in pregnancy and lactation**

While teratogenic effects were observed in animals nearly lethal doses,  no evidence suggests that this drug is teratogenic in humans [FDA label]. It is advisable, however, to avoid ASA use the first and second trimester of pregnancy, unless it is clearly required. If acetylsalicylic acid containing drugs are ingested by a patient attempting to conceive, or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, the lowest possible dose at the shortest possible duration should be taken [FDA label]. This drug is contraindicated in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy [FDA label]."

Histamine is a chemical that causes many of the signs that are part of allergic reactions, such as the swelling of tissues. Histamine is released from histamine-storing cells (mast cells) and attaches to other cells that have receptors for histamine. The attachment of the histamine to the receptors causes the cell to be ""activated,"" releasing other chemicals which produce the effects that we associate with allergy. Fexofenadine blocks one type of receptor for histamine (the H1 receptor) and thus prevents activation of cells by histamine. Unlike most other antihistamines, Fexofenadine does not enter the brain from the blood and, therefore, does not cause drowsiness. Fexofenadine lacks the cardiotoxic potential of terfenadine, since it does not block the potassium channel involved in repolarization of cardiac cells.","Like other H1-blockers, Fexofenadine competes with free histamine for binding at H1-receptors in the GI tract, large blood vessels, and bronchial smooth muscle.

Used as an antitussive, hydrocodone is combined with phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, guaifenesin, pyrilamine, pheniramine, or chlorpheniramine. Opiate agonists exert their principal pharmacologic effect at specific receptor binding sites in the CNS and other tissues. There are several subtypes of opiate receptors including the mu receptor (localized in pain modulating regions of the CNS), the kappa receptor (localized in the deep layers of the cerebral cortex), the delta receptor (localized in the limbic regions of the CNS), and the sigma receptor (thought to mediate the dysphoric and psychotomimetic effects of some opiate partial agonists). Agonist activity at the mu or kappa receptor can result in analgesia, miosis, and/or decreased body temperature. Agonist activity at the mu receptor can also result in suppression of opiate withdrawal, whereas antagonist activity can result in precipitation of withdrawal. Opiate agonists act at several sites within the CNS involving several systems of neurotransmitters to produce analgesia, but the precise mechanism of action has not been fully determined. Opiate agonists do not alter the threshold or responsiveness of afferent nerve endings to noxious stimuli nor the conduction of impulses along peripheral nerves. Instead, they alter the perception of pain at the spinal cord and higher levels in the CNS and the person's emotional response to pain.","Hydrocodone acts as a weak agonist at OP1, OP2, and OP3 opiate receptors within the central nervous system (CNS). Hydrocodone primarily affects OP3 receptors, which are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as modulators, both positive and negative, of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids such as hydrocodone also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist).

This observation is currently being explored in clinical trials. Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan works by blocking the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secretory effects of angiotensin II.","Telmisartan interferes with the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin II AT<sub>1</sub>-receptor by binding reversibly and selectively to the receptors in vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor, which also stimulates the synthesis and release of aldosterone, blockage of its effects results in decreases in systemic vascular resistance. Telmisartan does not inhibit the angiotensin converting enzyme, other hormone receptors, or ion channels. Studies also suggest that telmisartan is a partial agonist of PPAR&gamma;, which is an established target for antidiabetic drugs.

"DB00973","APRD00619","small molecule",2005-06-13,2019-07-02,"Ezetimibe","Ezetimibe is a lipid-lowering compound that inhibits intestinal cholesterol and related phytosterol absorption. The discovery and research of this drug began in the early 1990's, where intravenous administration of radio-labelled compound in rats resulting in subsequent localization of the drug within enterocytes at the intestinal villus, leading to studies of investigating the effect of ezetimibe on intestinal cholesterol absorption [A15202]. Ezetimibe is used as an adjunctive therapy to diet to lower cholesterol levels in primary hyperlipidemia, mixed hyperlipidemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), and homozygous sitosterolemia (phytosterolemia) [FDA Label].

Unlike other classes of cholesterol-reducing compounds including statins and bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe has a distinct mechanism of action involving the sterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), and is the first drug that does not affect absorption of fat-soluble nutrients such as fat-soluble vitamins, triglycerides, or bile acids [A33313]. In genetically NPC1L1-deficient mice, a 70% reduction in intestinal cholesterol absorption was seen and the mice were insensitive to ezetimibe treatment [A15202]. Based on these findings, it is indicated that NPC1L1 plays an essential role in promoting intestinal cholesterol uptake via an ezetimibe-sensitive pathway [A15202]. By interfering with the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols, ezetimibe reduces the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver [FDA Label].","163222-33-1","EOR26LQQ24",409.4252,409.148949953,"solid",1,4,0,0,"Venkataraman Sundaram, Srinivasam Rajan, Vaddadi Ramayya, Sunkara Vardhan, Bulusu Subrahmanyam, Cheemalapati Sasikala, ""Polymorphs of ezetimibe and process for preparation thereof."" U.S. Patent US20050171080, issued August 04, 2005.","Ezetimibe is indicated to reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia, alone or in combination with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia in combination with fenofibrate, reduce elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), in combination with atorvastatin or simvastatin, and to reduce elevated sitosterol and campesterol in patients with homozygous sitosterolemia (phytosterolemia) [FDA Label].","Ezetimibe was shown to reduce the levels of total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apoprotein B (Apo B), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with hyperlipidemia [FDA Label]. This therapeutic effect was more profound when ezetimibe was co-administered with a statin or fenofibrate compared to either treatment alone [FDA Label]. In clinical trials involving patients with homozygous and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and in those with sitosterolemia, a recommended therapeutic dose of ezetimibe was effective in reducing the LDL levels by 15-20% while increasing HDL-C by 2.5-5% [A33313].","Ezetimibe mediates its blood cholesterol-lowering effect via selectively inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol and phytosterol by the small intestine without altering the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and nutrients [A15202]. The primary target of ezetimibe is the cholesterol transport protein Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein. NPC1L1 is expressed at the enterocyte/ gut lumen (apical) as well as the hepatobiliary (canalicular) interface and plays a role in facilitating internalization of free cholesterol into the enterocyte in conjunction with the adaptor protein 2 (AP2) complex and clathrin [A33309]. Once cholesterol in the gut lumen or bile is incorporated into the cell membrane of enterocytes, it can bind to the sterol-sensing domain of NPC1L1 and form a NPC1L1/cholesterol complex. The complex can then be internalized or endocytosed by joining to AP2 clathrin, forming a vesicle complex that is translocated for storage in the endocytic recycling compartment [A33309]. 

Ezetimibe does not require exocrine pancreatic function for its pharmacological activity; rather, it localizes and appears to act at the brush border of the small intestine. Ezetimibe selectively blocks the NPC1L1 protein in the jejunal brush border, reducing the uptake of intestinal lumen micelles into the enterocyte [A33309]. Overall, ezetimibe causes a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver and reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood. While the full mechanism of action of ezetimibe in reducing the entry of cholesterol into both enterocytes and hepatocytes is not fully understood, a study proposed that ezetimibe prevents the NPC1L1/sterol complex from interacting with AP2 in clathrin coated vesicles and induces a conformational change in NPC1L1, rendering it incapable of binding to sterols [A33309]. Another study suggested that ezetimibe disrupts the function of other proteins complexes involved in regulating cholesterol uptake, including the CAV1– annexin 2 heterocomplex [A33309].","In humans, ezetimibe is rapidly and extensively metabolized via a phase II glucuronide conjugation reaction in the small intestine and liver to form its main phenolic metabolite, ezetimibe glucuronide. The main human liver and/or intestinal uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes responsible for glucuronidating ezetimibe were shown to be UGT1A1, 1A3 and 2B15 _in vitro_ [A15202]. Minimal phase I reaction involving oxidation of ezetimibe also occurs to form SCH 57871, and human jejunum microsomes also produced trace levels of a benzylic glucuronide (SCH 488128) [A15202]. Ezetimibe glucuronide accounts for 80-90% of the total circulating compound in plasma, and retains some pharmacological activity in inhibiting intestinal cholesterol uptake [FDA Label]. In humans, ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide constitutes approximately 93% of the total drug in plasma [FDA Label]. Plasma concentration-time profiles exhibit multiple peaks, suggesting enterohepatic recycling [FDA Label], and about 20% of the drug distributed is reabsorbed due to enterohepatic re-circulation [F133].","Administration of a single 10-mg dose of ezetimibe in fasted adults resulted in a peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of 3.4 to 5.5 ng/mL were achieved within 4 to 12 hours (Tmax) [FDA Label]. The Cmax of the major pharmacologically-active metabolite, ezetimibe-glucuronide, was 45 to 71 ng/mL and the Tmax was between 1 and 2 hours [FDA Label]. Food consumption had minimal effect on ezetimibe absorption, but the Cmax was increased by 38% with consumption of high-fat meals [FDA Label]. The absolute bioavailability of ezetimibe cannot be determined, as the compound is virtually insoluble in aqueous media suitable for injection [FDA Label].","Both ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide display an approximate half-life of 22 hours [FDA Label].","Ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide are >90% bound to human plasma proteins [FDA label]. The mean _in vitro_ protein binding ranged from 99.5% to 99.8% for ezetimibe and 87.8% to 92.0% for ezetimibe-glucuronide [A15202].","Following oral administration, about 78% and 11% of the administered radio-labelled ezetimibe were recovered in the feces and urine, respectively [FDA Label].

Doxorubicin is also indicated for use as a component of adjuvant therapy in women with evidence of axillary lymph node involvement following resection of primary breast cancer.","Doxorubicin is an antineoplastic in the anthracycline class. General properties of drugs in this class include: interaction with DNA in a variety of different ways including intercalation (squeezing between the base pairs), DNA strand breakage and inhibition with the enzyme topoisomerase II. Most of these compounds have been isolated from natural sources and antibiotics. However, they lack the specificity of the antimicrobial antibiotics and thus produce significant toxicity. The anthracyclines are among the most important antitumor drugs available. Doxorubicin is widely used for the treatment of several solid tumors while daunorubicin and idarubicin are used exclusively for the treatment of leukemia. Doxorubicin may also inhibit polymerase activity, affect regulation of gene expression, and produce free radical damage to DNA. Doxorubicin possesses an antitumor effect against a wide spectrum of tumors, either grafted or spontaneous. The anthracyclines are cell cycle-nonspecific.","Doxorubicin has antimitotic and cytotoxic activity through a number of proposed mechanisms of action: Doxorubicin forms complexes with DNA by intercalation between base pairs, and it inhibits topoisomerase II activity by stabilizing the DNA-topoisomerase II complex, preventing the religation portion of the ligation-religation reaction that topoisomerase II catalyzes.","Doxorubicin is capable of undergoing 3 metabolic routes: one-electron reduction, two-electron reduction, and deglycosidation. However, approximately half of the dose is eliminated from the body unchanged. Two electron reduction yields doxorubicinol, a secondary alcohol. This pathway is considered the primary metabolic pathway. The one electron reduction is facilitated by several oxidoreductases to form a doxirubicin-semiquinone radical.  These enzymes include mitochondrial and cystolic NADPH dehydrogenates, xanthine oxidase, and nitric oxide synthases. Deglycosidation is a minor metabolic pathway (1-2% of the dose undergoes this pathway). The resultant metabolites are deoxyaglycone or hydroxyaglycone formed via reduction or hydrolysis respectively. Enzymes that may be involved with this pathway include xanthine oxidase, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, and cytosolic NADPH dehydrogenase.",NA,"Terminal half life = 20 - 48 hours.","Doxorubicin and its major metabolite, doxorubicinol, is 74-76% bound to plasma protein.

Salbutamol is formulated as a racemic mixture of the R- and S-isomers. The R-isomer has 150 times greater affinity for the beta2-receptor than the S-isomer and the S-isomer has been associated with toxicity. This lead to the development of levalbuterol, the single R-isomer of salbutamol. However, the high cost of levalbuterol compared to salbutamol has deterred wide-spread use of this enantiomerically pure version of the drug. Salbutamol is generally used for acute episodes of bronchospasm caused by bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).

This inhibitory action is highly selective as the drug must be converted to the active form by a virus-encoded cellular enzyme, thymidine kinase (TK).

When used as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase, ganciclovir triphosphate competitively inhibits dATP leading to the formation of 'faulty' DNA. This is where ganciclovir triphosphate is incorporated into the DNA strand replacing many of the adenosine bases. This results in the prevention of DNA synthesis, as phosphodiester bridges can longer to be built, destabilizing the strand.

Estrogens are produced by the conversion of androgens through the activity of the aromatase enzyme. Letrozole blocks the production of estrogens in this way by competitive, reversible binding to the heme of its cytochrome P450 unit. It is important to note that letrozole does not decrease the production of mineralocorticoids or corticosteroids. In contrast, the antiestrogenic action of tamoxifen, the major medical therapy prior to the arrival of aromatase inhibitors, is due to its interfering with the estrogen receptor, rather than inhibiting estrogen production.
 Side effects include signs and symptoms of hypoestrogenism. There is concern that long term use may lead to osteoporosis, which is why prescriptions of Letrozole are often accompanied by prescriptions of osteoporosis-fighting medication such as Fosamax.
Letrozole has shown to reduce estrogen levels by 98 percent while raising testosterone levels. The anti-estrogen action of letrozole is preferred by athletes and bodybuilders for use during a steroid cycle to reduce bloating due to excess water retention and prevent the formation of gynecomastia related breast tissue that is a side effect of some anabolic steroids. Usage above 2.5 mg/day is known to potentially temporarily kill sex drive. Above 5mg/day for extended periods may cause kidney problems.

It is also used as a component of pretransplant conditioning regimens in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia and nonmalignant diseases.","Busulfan is an antineoplastic in the class of alkylating agents and is used to treat various forms of cancer. Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. They stop tumor growth by cross-linking guanine bases in DNA double-helix strands - directly attacking DNA. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. In addition, these drugs add methyl or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn leads to a miscoding of DNA. Alkylating agents are cell cycle-nonspecific and work by three different mechanisms, all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death. Overexpression of MGST2, a glutathione s-transferase, is thought to confer resistance to busulfan. The role of MGST2 in the metabolism of busulfan is unknown however.","Busulfan is an alkylating agent that contains 2 labile methanesulfonate groups attached to opposite ends of a 4-carbon alkyl chain. Once busulfan is hydrolyzed, the methanesulfonate groups are released and carbonium ions are produced. These carbonium ions alkylate DNA, which results in the interference of DNA replication and RNA transcription, ultimately leading to the disruption of nucleic acid function. Specifically, its mechanism of action through alkylation produces guanine-adenine intrastrand crosslinks. These crosslinks occur through a SN2 reaction guanine N7 nucleophilically attacks the carbon adjacent to the mesylate leaving group. This kind of damage cannot be repaired by cellular machinery and thus the cell undergoes apoptosis.","Busulfan is extensively metabolizes in the hepatic. Busulfan is predominantly metabolized by conjugation with glutathione, both spontaneously and by glutathione S-transferase (GST) catalysis. GSTA1 is the primary GST isoform that facilitates the the metabolism of busulfan. Other GST isoforms that are also involved are GSTM1 and GSTP1.

Sulfamethoxazole is bacteriostatic in nature. Inhibition of dihydrofolic acid synthesis decreases the synthesis of bacterial nucleotides and DNA. Sulfamethoxazole is normally given in combination with Trimethoprim, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, which inhibits the reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid. Studies have shown that bacterial resistance develops more slowly with the combination of the two drugs than with either Trimethoprim or Sulfamethoxazole alone.","Sulfonamides inhibit the enzymatic conversion of pteridine and p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) to dihydropteroic acid by competing with PABA for binding to dihydrofolate synthetase, an intermediate of tetrahydrofolic acid (THF) synthesis.

It belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating &beta; cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic &beta; cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Glyburide has been shown to decrease fasting plasma glucose, postprandial blood glucose and glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control). Glyburide appears to be completely metabolized, likely in the liver. Although its metabolites exert a small hypoglycemic effect, their contribution to glyburide's hypoglycemic effect is thought to be clinically unimportant. Glyburide metabolites are excreted in urine and feces in approximately equal proportions.","10238-21-8","SX6K58TVWC",494.004,493.143819418,"solid",1,1,0,0,"Suresh Gidwani, ""Solid oral dosage form of metformin and glyburide and the method of preparation thereof.""

With chronic administration in Type II diabetic patients, the blood glucose lowering effect persists despite a gradual decline in the insulin secretory response to the drug. Extrapancreatic effects may be involved in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonyl-urea hypoglycemic drugs. The combination of glibenclamide and metformin may have a synergistic effect, since both agents act to improve glucose tolerance by different but complementary mechanisms. In addition to its blood glucose lowering actions, glyburide produces a mild diuresis by enhancement of renal free water clearance. Glyburide is twice as potent as the related second-generation agent glipizide.","Sulfonylureas such as glyburide bind to ATP-sensitive potassium channels on the pancreatic cell surface, reducing potassium conductance and causing depolarization of the membrane. Depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels, raising intracellular concentrations of calcium ions, which induces the secretion, or exocytosis, of insulin.","Primarily hepatic (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4). The major metabolite is the 4-trans-hydroxy derivative. A second metabolite, the 3-cis-hydroxy derivative, also occurs.
