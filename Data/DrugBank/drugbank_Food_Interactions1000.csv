"DB08864","Absorption is increased by 40% if taken with food."
"DB08864","Co-administration with St. John's wort decreases levels of rilpivirine by inducing CYP3A4 metabolism. Use is contraindicated."
"DB08865","When given with a high-fat meal, AUC and Cmax were reduced by 14%. Despite this, crizotinib may be given with or without food."
"DB08867","A high fat meal may lower mean Cmax and increase mean AUC(0-8) but these changes are not clinically significant. Take without regards to meals."
"DB08872","No food effects."
"DB08873","Food increases the exposure of boceprevir by up to 65%. However, bioavailability is not affected and thus can be taken without regards to meals."
"DB08874","Food decreases Cmax of fidaxomicin and its metabolites however this is not considered clinically significant."
"DB08875","Avoid grapefruit juice. Combination may increase levels of cabozantinib. Also avoid all other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors."
"DB08876","No food effects found."
"DB08877","Take without regards to meals"
"DB08880","Food does not affect teriflunomide pharmacokinetics, so take with or without food."
"DB08882","Although a high fat meal reduces Cmax and increases AUC, this interaction with food is not clinically significant"
"DB08883","Food slows perampanel's absorption rate but not extent."
"DB08890","Even when taken with food, linaclotide does not reach detectable levels in the plasma. However, when taken with a high fat meal, one may observe looser stools and a higher stool frequency."
"DB08893","When taken with meals, levels of mirabegron decreased. Furthermore, the magnitude of this effect was greater if taken with a low fat meal, rather than a high fat meal. Despite these findings, dose adjustment is not required."
"DB08896","When taken with a high-fat meal, AUC increased by 48% and decreased mean AUC of M2 and M5 metabolites by 20% and 51% respectively."
"DB08898","No food effects were found."
"DB08903","When administered with food, relative bioavailability increases 2-fold"
"DB08908","Food does not affect the pharmacokinetics of dimethyl fumarate, but it may reduce dimethyl fumarate induced GI upset and flushing."
"DB08911","When taken with a high-fat, high-calorie meal, AUC and Cmax decreased. Tmax was also prolonged compared to fasted conditions."
"DB08912","When taken with a fatty meal, Cmax and AUC decreased. Tmax is also prolonged compared to the fasted condition."
"DB08913","Since radium Ra 223 dichloride is administered intravenously, no food effects should occur."
"DB08916","When given with a high-fat meal, Cmax decreases by 50% and AUC by 39% relative to the fasted state."
"DB08932","Can be taken with or without food."
"DB08934","Sofosbuvir can be given with or without food."
"DB08935","Echinacea: diminished therapeutic effect of immunosuppressants"
"DB09034","Grapefruit Juice"
"DB09049","A high-fat meal increased the extent and rate of naloxegol absorption. The Cmax and AUC were increased by approximately 30% and 45%, respectively. In clinical trials, naloxegol was dosed on an empty stomach approximately 1 hour prior to the first meal in the morning."
"DB09053","Administration with food increases ibrutinib exposure approximately 2-fold compared with administration after overnight fasting."
"DB09083","Grapefruit juice may increase ivabradine exposure by twofold (due to its inhibition of CYP3A4). Therefore grapefruit juice consumption is not recommended while taking ivabradine."
"DB09570","A food effect study conducted in patients with a single 4 mg dose of ixazomib showed that a high-fat meal decreased ixazomib AUC by 28% and Cmax by 69%."
"DB11575","Relative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of grazoprevir + elbasvir (Zapatier) with a high-fat (900 kcal, 500 kcal from fat) meal to healthy subjects resulted in decreases in elbasvir AUC0-inf and Cmax of approximately 11% and 15%, respectively, and increases in grazoprevir AUC0-inf and Cmax of approximately 1.5-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively."
